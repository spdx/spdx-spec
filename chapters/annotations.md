### 12.4.2 Intent

There may be several versions of the same snippet, package or file within an SPDX document. Each element needs to be able to be referred to uniquely so that relationships between elements can be clearly articulated.

### 12.4.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `SPDXREF:`

```text
SPDXREF: SPDXRef-45
```

```text
SPDXREF: DocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2:SPDXRef-5
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF:

For RDF, the annotations are a property of the SPDX document, package, file, or snippet they are annotating.

```text
<File rdf:about="#SPDXRef-45">
    <annotation>
        <Annotation>
            ...

the options.</text>
