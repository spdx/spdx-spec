# Composition of an SPDX document

## What this specification covers

This document contains the specification for an SPDX document, which is made up of a set of **zero/one** or more Facts, instances of which contain information in the form of *fields*. The following subclause introduces the different kinds of Facts allowed. The fields for each kind of Fact are defined in the clause corresponding to that Fact.

## Facts

### **1.4.1** SPDX Document Creation Information Fact

> For demonstation purposes, the hanging paragraph(s) from the beginning of Chapter 2 have been copied here and slightly edited.

An instance of this kind of Fact provides the necessary information for forward and backward compatibility for processing tools.

One instance is required for each SPDX file produced. 

Cardinality: Mandatory, one.

### **1.4.2** Package Information Fact

> For demonstation purposes, the hanging paragraph(s) from the beginning of Chapter 3 have been copied here and slightly edited.

An instance of this kind of Fact describes ...

One instance is required per package being described. A package may contain sub-packages, but the information in this section is a reference to the entire contents of the package listed. Starting with SPDX 2.0, it is not necessary to have a package wrapping a set of files.

Cardinality: Optional, one or many.

In `tag:value` format, the order in which package and files occur is syntactically significant.

A new Package Information section is denoted by the [Package Name](#3.1) field.

All Package Information fields shall be grouped together before the start of a [Files section](4-file-information.md), if file(s) are present.

All files contained in a package shall immediately follow the applicable Package Information.

A new Package Information section (via Package Name) denotes the start of another package.

Sub-packages should not be nested inside a Package Information section, but should be separate and should use a Relationship to clarify.
Annotations and Relationships for the package may appear after the Package Information before any file information.
