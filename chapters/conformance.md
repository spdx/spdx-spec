# 4 Conformance

## 4.1 SPDX Current and Previous Versions <a name="4.1"></a>

This edition has the version number 2.3 as part of its title. This is a follow on from [ISO/IEC 5962:2021
Information technology — SPDX® Specification V2.2.1](https://www.iso.org/standard/81870.html), and includes new fields.  Earlier editions were published by the SPDX workgroup via the Linux Foundation. The SPDX Specification was subsequently transposed into the Joint Development Foundation. [Those earlier editions are: 1.0 (August 2011), 1.1 (August 2012), 1.2 (October 2013), 2.0 (May 2015), 2.1 (November 2016), and 2.2 (May 2020).] Differences between this edition and earlier ones are reported in [Annex J](diffs-from-previous-editions.md); see also [[1]](bibliography.md).

## 4.2 Obsolete features <a name="4.2"></a>

Over the life of a standard, some older approaches can become obsolete and are dropped from subsequent editions, possibly with a replacement approach being provided. Such action involves *deprecating* those outdated features. This edition identifies all currently deprecated features.  No features present in 2.2.1 have been deprecated in this 2.3 release.

## 4.3 Alternate notation for some conformance requirements <a name="4.3"></a>

This standard contains more than a few *cardinality assertions*, each of which indicates absolute, optional, or conditional requirements. Here are some examples:

* Cardinality: Mandatory, one.
* Cardinality: Optional, one or many.
* Cardinality: Mandatory, one if {condition} is true or {feature} omitted, zero (shall be omitted) if {condition} is false.
* Cardinality: 0..1
* Cardinality: 0..\*
* Cardinality: 1..1
* Cardinality: 1..\*

Each of these assertions can easily be understood as to whether a feature is required, and if so, how many occurrences are required; also, whether a feature is permitted, and if so, in what number. As this is the format long familiar to the SPDX community, it has been preserved in this document.

## 4.4 Standard data format requirements <a name="4.4"></a>

The data format specification and recommendations are subject to the following constraints:

* Shall be in a human readable form.

* Shall be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write.

* Shall be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness automatically, independent of how it was generated (human or tool).

* The SPDX document character set shall support UTF-8 encoding.

* Multiple serialization formats may be used to represent the information being exchanged. Current supported formats include:

    * **YAML 1.2** see: <https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html>
    * **JavaScript Object Notation** (JSON) see: [ECMA-404](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf)
        * The JSON Schema for SPDX can be found in the [SPDX Spec Git Repository Schema directory](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/master/schemas/spdx-schema.json)
    * **Resource Description Framework** (RDF also referred to as RDF/XML) see: <https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/>
    * **tag:value** flat text file as described in this specification
    * **.xls** spreadsheets

* In addition to the supported formats, the following format is in development with a plan to complete the specification in the next release:

    * **Extensible Markup Language** (XML) see: <https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/>

* Interoperability between all the supported file formats shall be preserved. SPDX defines how to validate a document in each supported format, and how to translate a valid document without loss to each other supported format.

* Tags and format properties are case sensitive.

* Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file. A suggested naming convention is:

| Format      | Extension   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| tag:value   | \*.spdx      |
| RDF         | \*.spdx.rdf  |
| JSON        | \*.spdx.json |
| XML         | \*.spdx.xml  |
| YAML        | \*.spdx.yaml or \*.spdx.yml |

* The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use `rdf:about="..."` to represent that a proper Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) should be present.

## 4.5 Trademark Compliance <a name="4.5"></a>

## 4.6 The SPDX Lite profile <a name="4.6"></a>

Rather than conforming to this whole specification, an implementation may conform with SPDX Lite only, a profile that defines a subset of the SPDX specification. SPDX Lite aims at the balance between the SPDX standard and actual workflows in some industries. See [Annex G](SPDX-Lite.md) for more information.
