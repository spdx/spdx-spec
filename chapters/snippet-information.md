# 9 Snippet information section

## 9.1 Snippet SPDX identifier field <a name="9.1"></a>

### 9.1.1 Description

Uniquely identify any element in an SPDX document which may be referenced by other elements. These may be referenced internally and externally with the addition of the SPDX document identifier. The metadata for the snippet SPDX identifier field is shown in Table 52.

**Table 52 — Metadata for the snippet SPDX identifier field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | Yes |
| Cardinality | 1..1 |
| Format | `SPDXRef-[idstring]`<br>where `[idstring]` is a unique string containing letters, numbers, `.` and/or `-`. |

### 9.1.2 Intent

There may be several instances of a snippet within an SPDX document. Each snippet is an element which needs to be able to be referred to uniquely so that relationships between it and other elements can be clearly articulated.

### 9.1.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `SnippetSPDXID:`

```text
SnippetSPDXID: SPDXRef-1
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: 

The URI for the element shall follow the form: `[SpdxDocumentURI]#SPDXRef-[idstring]` where `[SpdxDocumentURI]` is the URI for the SPDX document containing the element.

Using xml:base:

```text
<rdf:RDF xml:base="http://acme.com/spdxdocs/acmeproj/v1.2/1BE2A4FF-5F1A-48D3-8483-28A9B0349A1B"
    ...
    <Snippet rdf:about="#SPDXRef-1">
        ...
    </Snippet>
```

Using document URI:

```text
<Snippet rdf:about="http://acme.com/spdxdocs/acmeproj/v1.2/1BE2A4FF-5F1A-48D3-8483-28A9B0349A1B#SPDXRef-1">
    ...
</Snippet>
```

## 9.2 Snippet from file SPDX identifier field <a name="9.2"></a>

### 9.2.1 Description

Uniquely identify the file in an SPDX document which this snippet is associated with. The metadata for the snippet from file SPDX identifier field is shown in Table 53.

**Table 53 — Metadata for the snippet from file SPDX identifier field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | Yes |
| Cardinality | 1..1 |
| Format | ["DocumentRef-"[idstring]":"] SPDXID<br>where `DocumentRef-[idstring]`: is an optional reference to an external SPDX document as described in [6.6](document-creation-information.md#6.6)<br>where `SPDXID` is a string containing letters, numbers, `.` and/or `-`. as described in ([6.3](document-creation-information.md#6.3), [7.2](package-information.md#7.2), [8.2](file-information.md#8.2)). |

### 9.2.2 Intent

There may be several versions of the same file within an SPDX document. Each element needs to be able to be referred to uniquely so that relationships between elements can be clearly articulated.

### 9.2.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `SnippetFromFileSPDXID:`

Snippet from a File in local SPDX Doc:

```text
SnippetFromFileSPDXID: SPDXRef-filecontainingsnippet
```

Snippet from a File in an External SPDX Doc:

```text
SnippetFromFileSPDXID: DocumentRef-ExternalDoc1:SPDXRef-filecontainingsnippet
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:snippetFromFile` in class `spdx:Snippet`

Snippet from a File in local SPDX Doc:

```text
<Snippet rdf:ID="SPDXRef-1">
    <snippetFromFile rdf:about="#SPDXRef-filecontainingsnippet">
        ...
    </Snippet>
```

Snippet from a File in an External SPDX Doc:

```text
<Snippet rdf:ID="SPDXRef-1">
    <snippetFromFile rdf:about="http://foo.org/ExternalDocument1#SPDXRef-filecontainingsnippet">
    ...
</Snippet>
```

## 9.3 Snippet byte range field <a name="9.3"></a>

### 9.3.1 Description

This field defines the byte range in the original host file (in [9.2](#9.2)) that the snippet information applies to. The metadata for the snippet byte range field is shown in Table 54.

**Table 54 — Metadata for the snippet byte range field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | Yes |
| Cardinality | 1..1 |
| Format | `number1:number2`<br>where: `number1` is greater than or equal to 1 and less or equal to `number2`,<br>AND `number2` is less than or equal to the total number of bytes in file.<br><br>The byte at position number1 and position number2 are included in the range. |

### 9.3.2 Intent

A range of bytes is independent of various formatting concerns, and the most accurate way of referring to the differences. The choice was made to start the numbering of the byte range at 1 to be consistent with the W3C pointer method vocabulary (see [http://www.w3.org/TR/Pointers-in-RDF10/](http://www.w3.org/TR/Pointers-in-RDF10/)).

### 9.3.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `SnippetByteRange:`

```text
SnippetByteRange: 310:420
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:Range` in class `spdx:Snippet`. 

The RDF uses the W3C proposed pointer method vocabulary (see [http://www.w3.org/TR/Pointers-in-RDF10/](http://www.w3.org/TR/Pointers-in-RDF10/)

Supported classes from the pointer method vocabulary are `StartEndPointer` and `ByteOffsetPointer`. Supported properties from the pointer method vocabulary include:

* `startPointer`
* `endPointer`
* `reference`
* `offset`

```text
<Snippet rdf:about="...">
    <range>
        <ptr:StartEndPointer>
            <ptr:startPointer>
                <ptr:ByteOffsetPointer>
                    <ptr:reference rdf:resource="#SPDXRef-fileReference/>
                    <ptr:offset>310</ptr:offset>
                </ptr:ByteOffsetPointer>
            </ptr:startPointer>
            <ptr:endPointer>
                <ptr:ByteOffsetPointer>
                    <ptr:reference  rdf:resource="#SPDXRef-fileReference/>
                    <ptr:offset>420</ptr:offset>
                </ptr:ByteOffsetPointer>
            </ptr:endPointer>
        </ptr: StartEndPointer>
    </range>
</Snippet>
```

This specification uses the prefix `ptr:` to refer to the [W3C Pointers][pointers] namespace:

```text
xmlns:ptr=http://www.w3.org/2009/pointers#
```

## 9.4 Snippet line range field <a name="9.4"></a>

### 9.4.1 Description

This optional field defines the line range in the original host file (see [9.2](#9.2)) that the snippet information applies to. If there is a disagreement between the byte range and line range, the byte range values will take precedence. The metadata for the snippet line range field is shown in Table 55.

**Table 55 — Metadata for the snippet line range field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | No |
| Cardinality | 0..1 |
| Format | `number1:number2`<br>where:<br>`number1` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `number2`,<br>AND `number2` is less than or equal to the total number of lines in file. |

### 9.4.2 Intent

A range of lines is a convenient reference for those files where there is a known line delimiter. The choice was made to start the numbering of the lines at 1 to be consistent with the W3C pointer method vocabulary (see [http://www.w3.org/TR/Pointers-in-RDF10/](http://www.w3.org/TR/Pointers-in-RDF10/)).

### 9.4.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `SnippetLineRange:`

```text
SnippetLineRange: 5:23
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Properties `spdx:Range` in class `spdx:Snippet`.

The RDF uses the W3C proposed pointer method vocabulary (see <http://www.w3.org/TR/Pointers-in-RDF10/>).

Supported classes from the pointer method vocabulary are `StartEndPointer` and `LineCharPointer`. Supported properties from the pointer method vocabulary include:

* `startPointer`
* `endPointer`
* `reference`
* `lineNumber`

```text
<Snippet rdf:about="...">
    <range>
        <ptr:StartEndPointer>
            <ptr:startPointer>
                <ptr:LineCharPointer>
                    <ptr:reference rdf:resource="#SPDXRef-fileReference"/>
                    <ptr:lineNumber>5</ptr:lineNumber>
                </ptr:LineCharPointer>
            </ptr:startPointer>
            <ptr:endPointer>
            <ptr:LineCharPointer>
                <ptr:reference rdf:resource="#SPDXRef-fileReference"/>
                <ptr:lineNumber>23</ptr:lineNumber>
            </ptr:LineCharPointer>
        </ptr: StartEndPointer>
    </range>
</Snippet>
```

## 9.5 Snippet concluded license field <a name="9.5"></a>

### 9.5.1 Description

This field contains the license the SPDX document creator has concluded as governing the snippet or alternative values if the governing license cannot be determined. The options to populate this field are limited to:

* A valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Annex [D](SPDX-license-expressions.md).
* `NONE` should be used if there is no licensing information from which to conclude a license for the snippet.
* `NOASSERTION` should be used if for the snippet:

    - the SPDX document creator has attempted to, but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination of the Concluded License;
    - the SPDX document creator is uncomfortable concluding a license, despite some license information being available;
    - the SPDX document creator has made no attempt to determine a Concluded License;
    - the SPDX document creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

If the Concluded License is not the same as the License Information in Snippet, a written explanation should be provided in the Comments on License field (see [9.7](#9.7)). With respect to `NOASSERTION`, a written explanation in the Comments on License field (see [9.7](#9.7)) is preferred. If the Snippet Concluded License field is not present for a snippet, it implies an equivalent meaning to `NOASSERTION`. The metadata for the snippet concluded license field is shown in Table 56.

**Table 56 — Metadata for the snippet concluded license field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | No |
| Cardinality | 0..1 |
| Format | `<SPDX License Expression>` \| `NONE` \| `NOASSERTION`<br>where:<br>`<SPDX License Expression>` is a valid SPDX License Expression as defined in [Annex D](SPDX-license-expressions.md). |

### 9.5.2 Intent

Here, the intent is for the SPDX document creator to reconcile the license information known about the snippet, what license information is in the snippet itself and other objective information for a package, along with the results from any scanning tools, to arrive at a reasonably objective conclusion as to what license governs the snippet.

### 9.5.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `SnippetLicenseConcluded:`

```text
SnippetLicenseConcluded: GPL-2.0-only
```

```text
SnippetLicenseConcluded: (LGPL-2.0-only OR LicenseRef-2)
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:licenseConcluded` in class `spdx:Snippet`

```text
<Snippet rdf:about="...">
    ...
    <licenseConcluded>GPL-2.0-only</licenseConcluded>
    ...
</Snippet>
```

```text
<Snippet rdf:about="...">
    <licenseConcluded>
        <DisjunctiveLicenseSet>
            <member rdf:resource
              ="http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-only"/>
            <member rdf:resource="#LicenseRef-2"/>
        </DisjunctiveLicenseSet>
    </licenseConcluded>
</Snippet>
```

## 9.6 License information in snippet field <a name="9.6"></a>

### 9.6.1 Description

This field contains the license information actually found in the snippet, if any. Any license information not actually in the snippet itself, e.g., header of the file the snippet belongs in, “COPYING.txt” file in a top level directory, should not be reflected in this field.

The options to populate this field are limited to:

* A valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Annex [D](SPDX-license-expressions.md).
* `NONE`, if the snippet contains no license information whatsoever; or
* `NOASSERTION`, if:

    - the SPDX document creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or
    - the SPDX document creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

If license information for more than one license is contained in the snippet or if the license information offers a choice of licenses, then each of the choices should be listed as a separate entry. If the License Information in Snippet field is not present for a snippet, it implies an equivalent meaning to `NOASSERTION`. The metadata for the license information in snippet field is shown in Table 57.

**Table 57 — Metadata for the license information in snippet field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | No |
| Cardinality | 0..\* |
| Format | `<SPDX License Expression>` \| `NONE` \| `NOASSERTION`<br>where:<br>`<SPDX License Expression>` is a valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Annex [D](SPDX-license-expressions.md). |

### 9.6.2 Intent

Here, the intent is to provide the license information actually in the snippet, as compared to the Concluded License field.

### 9.6.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `LicenseInfoInSnippet:`

```text
LicenseInfoInSnippet: LGPL-2.0-only
```

```text
LicenseInfoInSnippet: LicenseRef-2
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:licenseInfoInSnippet` in class `spdx:Snippet`

```text
<Snippet rdf:about="...">
    <licenseInfoInSnippet rdf:resource
      ="http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only" />
    <licenseInfoInSnippet rdf:resource="#LicenseRef-2" />
</Snippet>
```

## 9.7 Snippet comments on license field <a name="9.7"></a>

### 9.7.1 Description

This field provides a place for the SPDX document creator to record any relevant background references or analysis that went in to arriving at the Concluded License for a snippet. The metadata for the snippet comments on license field is shown in Table 58.

```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:licenseComments` in class `spdx:Snippet`

```text
<Snippet rdf:about="...">
    ...
    <licenseComments>
        The concluded license was taken from package xyz, from which the
        snippet was copied into the current file. The concluded license
        information was found in the COPYING.txt file in package xyz.
    </licenseComments>
    ...
</Snippet>
```

## 9.8 Snippet copyright text field <a name="9.8"></a>

### 9.8.1 Description

Identify the copyright holder of the snippet, as well as any dates present. This shall be a free form text field, ideally extracted from the actual snippet.  The options to populate this field are limited to:

any text relating to a copyright notice, even if not complete;

`NONE`, if the snippet contains no copyright information whatsoever; or

`NOASSERTION`, if the SPDX document creator has not examined the contents of the actual snippet or if the SPDX document creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied from the absence of an assertion).

If the Snippet Copyright Text field is not present for a snippet, it implies an equivalent meaning to `NOASSERTION`. The metadata for the snippet copyright text field is shown in Table 59.

**Table 59 — Metadata for the snippet copyright text field**
