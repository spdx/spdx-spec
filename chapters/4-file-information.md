# 4 File Information{#File-Information}

One instance of the File Information is required for each file in the software package. It provides important meta information about a given file including licenses and copyright. Starting with SPDX 2.0, it is not necessary to have a package wrapping a set of files.

When implementing `tag:value` format, the positioning of File elements is syntactically significant:

Files are assumed to be associated with the Package Information that immediately precedes it, if a package exists.
Presence of a new Package Information signals the end of the set of files associated with the preceding package, unless an explicit Relationship is used.
If a package contains files, the File Information section must follow its Package Information section.
If a File is not part of any package, it must precede any Package Information section reference in the SPDX document.
The first field to start off the description of a File must be the File Name in `tag:value` format.
File information is associated with the File Name that precedes it.
Annotations on the file and Relationships from the file may appear after the file information, before the next file or Package Information section.

When implementing file information in RDF, the `spdx:hasFile` property is used to associate the package with the file.

## 4.1 File Name <a name="4.1"></a>{#section4.1}

**4.1.1** Purpose: Identify the full path and filename that corresponds to the file information in this section.

**4.1.2** Intent: To aid finding the correct file which corresponds to the file information.

**4.1.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one.

**4.1.4** Data Format: A relative filename with the root of the package archive or directory.

In general, every filename is preceded with a `./`, see [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) for syntax.

**4.1.5** Tag: `FileName:`

Example:

    FileName: ./package/foo.c

**4.1.6** RDF: Property `spdx:fileName` in class `spdx:File`

Example:

    <File rdf:about="...">
        <fileName>./package/foo.c</fileName>
        ...
    </File>

## 4.2 File SPDX Identifier <a name="4.2"></a>

**4.2.1** Purpose: Uniquely identify any element in an SPDX document which may be referenced by other elements. These may be referenced internally and externally with the addition of the SPDX Document Identifier.

**4.2.2** Intent: There may be several versions of the same file within an SPDX document. Each element needs to be able to be referred to uniquely so that relationships between elements can be clearly articulated.

**4.2.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one.

**4.2.4** DataFormat: "SPDXRef-"`[idstring]`

where `[idstring]` is a unique string containing letters, numbers, `.` and/or `-`.

**4.2.5** Tag: `SPDXID:`

Example:

    SPDXID: SPDXRef-1

**4.2.6** RDF: The URI for the element will follow the form: [SpdxDocumentURI]#SPDXRef-[idstring] where [SpdxDocumentURI] is the URI for the SPDX Document containing the element.

Example using `xml:base:`

    <rdf:RDF xml:base="http://acme.com/spdxdocs/acmeproj/v1.2/1BE2A4FF-5F1A-48D3-8483-28A9B0349A1B"
        ...
        <File rdf:ID=”SPDXRef-1”>
            ...
        </File>

Example using document URI:

    <File rdf:about="http://acme.com/spdxdocs/acmeproj/v1.2/1BE2A4FF-5F1A-48D3-8483-28A9B0349A1B#SPDXRef-1">
        ...
    </File>

## 4.3 File Type <a name="4.3"></a>

**4.3.1** Purpose: This field provides information about the type of file identified. File Type is intrinsic to the file, independent of how the file is being used. A file may have more than one file type assigned to it, however the options to populate this field are limited to:

* `SOURCE` if the file is human readable source code (.c, .html, etc.);
* `BINARY` if the file is a compiled object, target image or binary executable (.o, .a, etc.);
* `ARCHIVE` if the file represents an archive (.tar, .jar, etc.);
* `APPLICATION` if the file is associated with a specific application type (MIME type of application/*);
* `AUDIO` if the file is associated with an audio file (MIME type of audio/* , e.g. .mp3);
* `IMAGE` if the file is associated with an picture image file (MIME type of image/*, e.g., .jpg, .gif);
* `TEXT` if the file is human readable text file (MIME type of text/*);
* `VIDEO` if the file is associated with a video file type (MIME type of video/*);
* `DOCUMENTATION` if the file serves as documentation;
* `SPDX` if the file is an SPDX document;
* `OTHER` if the file doesn't fit into the above categories (generated artifacts, data files, etc.)

**4.3.2** Intent: Here, this field is a reasonable estimation of the file type, from a developer perspective.

**4.3.3** Cardinality: Optional, multiple.

**4.3.4** Data Format: `SOURCE` | `BINARY` | `ARCHIVE` | `APPLICATION` | `AUDIO` | `IMAGE` | `TEXT` | `VIDEO` | `DOCUMENTATION` | `SPDX` | `OTHER`

**4.3.5** Tag: `FileType:`

Example:

    FileType: BINARY

Example: (for a `README.TXT`)

    FileType: TEXT
    FileType: DOCUMENTATION

Example (foo.exe)

    FileType: BINARY
    FileType: APPLICATION

**4.3.6** RDF: Property `spdx:fileType` in class `spdx:File`

Example:

    <File rdf:about="file1">
        <fileType rdf:resource="fileType_binary" />
    </File>

Example: (where file2 is a `README.TXT`)

    <File rdf:about="file2">
        <fileType rdf:resource="http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#fileType_text" />
        <fileType rdf:resource="http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#fileType_documentation" />
    </File>

## 4.4 File Checksum <a name="4.4"></a>


**4.4.1** Purpose: Provide a unique identifier to match analysis information on each specific file in a package.

**4.4.2** Intent: Here, by providing a unique identifier of each file, confusion over which version/modification of a specific file should be eliminated.

**4.4.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one SHA1, others may be optionally provided.

**4.4.4** Algorithm: SHA1() is to be used on the file. Other algorithms that can be provided optionally include SHA256(), MD5().

**4.4.5** Data Format: In `tag:value` there are three components, an algorithm identifier (SHA1), a separator (“:”) and a checksum value. The RDF must also contain an algorithm identifier and a checksum value. For example, when the algorithm identifier is SHA1, the checksum value should be a 160 bit value represented as 40 lowercase hexadecimal digits. For other algorithms, an appropriate number of hexadecimal digits is expected.

**4.4.6** Tag: `FileChecksum:`

Example:

    FileChecksum: SHA1: d6a770ba38583ed4bb4525bd96e50461655d2758

    FileChecksum: MD5: 624c1abb3664f4b35547e7c73864ad24

**4.4.7** RDF: Property `spdx:Checksum` in class `spdx:File`

Example:

    <File rdf:about="...">
        <checksum>
            <Checksum>
                <algorithm rdf:resource="http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#checksumAlgorithm_sha1"/>
                <checksumValue>d6a770ba38583ed4bb4525bd96e50461655d2758
                </checksumValue>
            </Checksum>
        </checksum>
        <checksum>
            <Checksum>
                <algorithm rdf:resource="http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#checksumAlgorithm_md5"/>
                <checksumValue> 624c1abb3664f4b35547e7c73864ad24
                </checksumValue>
            </Checksum>
        </checksum>
    </File>

## 4.5 Concluded License <a name="4.5"></a>

**4.5.1** Purpose: This field contains the license the SPDX file creator has concluded as governing the file or alternative values if the governing license cannot be determined.

The options to populate this field are limited to:

A valid SPDX License Expression as defined in [Appendix IV](#SPDX-License-Expressions);

`NONE`, if the SPDX file creator concludes there is no license available for this file; or

`NOASSERTION`, if:

(i) the SPDX file creator has attempted to, but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination;

(ii) the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or

(iii) the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

If the Concluded License is not the same as the License Information in File, a written explanation should be provided in the Comments on License field [(section 4.7)](#section4.7). With respect to `NOASSERTION`, a written explanation in the Comments on License field [(section 4.7)](#section4.7) is preferred.

**4.5.2** Intent: Here, the intent is for the SPDX file creator to analyze the License Information in file [(section 4.6)](#section4.6) and other objective information, e.g., “COPYING FILE,” along with the results from any scanning tools, to arrive at a reasonably objective conclusion as to what license governs the file.

**4.5.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one.

**4.5.4** Data Format: `<SPDX License Expression>` | `NONE` | `NOASSERTION`

where:

`<SPDX License Expression>` is a valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Appendix IV.

Example:

    <File rdf:about="file">
        <licenseConcluded>LGPL-2.0</licenseConcluded>
    </File>

Example:

    <File rdf:about="...">
        <licenseConcluded>
            <DisjunctiveLicenseSet>
                <member rdf:resource="http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0"/>
                <member rdf:resource="#LicenseRef-2"/>

        </licenseConcluded>
    </File>

## 4.6 License Information in File <a name="4.6"></a>{#section.4.6}

**4.6.1** Purpose: This field contains the license information actually found in the file, if any. This information is most commonly found in the header of the file, although it may be in other areas of the actual file. Any license information not actually in the file, e.g., “COPYING.txt” file in a top level directory, should not be reflected in this field.

The options to populate this field are limited to:

The SPDX License List short form identifier, if the license is on the SPDX License List;
A reference to the license, denoted by LicenseRef-`[idstring]`, if the license is not on the SPDX License List;

`NONE`, if the file contains no license information whatsoever; or

`NOASSERTION`, if:

(i) the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or

(ii) the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

If license information for more than one license is contained in the file or if the license information offers the package recipient a choice of licenses, then each of the choices should be listed as a separate entry.

**4.6.2** Intent: Here, the intent is to provide the license information actually in the file, as compared to the Concluded License field.

**4.6.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one or many.

**4.6.4** Data Format: `<SPDX License Expression>` |

 ["DocumentRef-"`[idstring]`":"]"LicenseRef-"`[idstring]` |

 | `NONE` | `NOASSERTION`

where:

`<SPDX License Expression>` is a valid SPDX License Expression

as defined in [Appendix IV](#File-Information).

"DocumentRef-"`[idstring]`: is an optional reference to an external SPDX

document as described in [section 2.6](section#2.6)

`[idstring]` is a unique string containing letters, numbers, `.` and/or `-`

        <licenseInfoInFile rdf:resource="#LicenseRef-2" />
    </File>

## 4.7 Comments on License <a name="4.7"></a>{#section4.7}

**4.7.1** Purpose: This field provides a place for the SPDX file creator to record any relevant background references or analysis that went in to arriving at the Concluded License for a file. If the Concluded License does not match the License Information in File, this should be explained by the SPDX file creator. It is also preferable to include an explanation here when the Concluded License is `NOASSERTION`.

**4.7.2** Intent: Here, the intent is to provide the recipient of the SPDX file with a detailed explanation of how the Concluded License was determined if it does not match the License Information in File, is marked `NOASSERTION`, or other helpful information relevant to determining the license of the file.

**4.7.3** Cardinality: Optional, one.

**4.7.4** Data Format: Free form text that can span multiple lines

**4.7.5** Tag: `LicenseComments:`

In `tag:value` format multiple lines are delimited by `<text> .. </text>`.

    This information was found in the COPYING.txt file in the xyz directory.</text>

**4.7.6** RDF: Property `spdx:licenseComments` in class `spdx:File`

Example:

    <File rdf:about="...">
        <licenseComments>
            The concluded license was taken from the package level that the file
            was included in. This information was found in the COPYING.txt file
            in the xyz directory. This package has been shipped in source and binary form.
        </licenseComments>
    </File>

## 4.8 Copyright Text <a name="4.8"></a>

The options to populate this field are limited to:

Any text relating to a copyright notice, even if not complete;

`NONE`, if the file contains no copyright information whatsoever; or

`NOASSERTION`, if

(i) the SPDX document creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or

(ii) the SPDX document creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied from the absence of an assertion).

**4.8.2** Intent: Record any copyright notice for the file.

**4.8.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one.

**4.8.4** Data Format: Free form text that can span multiple lines | `NONE` | `NOASSERTION`

    </File>

##4.9 Artifact of Project Name (deprecated) <a name="4.9"></a>

**4.9.1** Purpose: To indicate that a file has been derived from a specific project.

**4.9.2** Intent: To make it easier for recipients of the SPDX file to determine the original source of the identified file. If the project is not described in an SPDX Document, then ArtifactOf can be used.

If the project is described in another SPDX Document, then Relationship should be used.

**4.9.3** Cardinality: Optional, one or many.

**4.9.4** Data Format: Single line of text. In `tag:value` format the ArtifactOfProjectName must precede any optional ArtifactOf optional properties (e.g. ArtifactOfHomePage and ArtifactOfURI).

    </File>

## 4.15 File Dependencies (deprecated) <a name="4.15"></a>

This field is deprecated since SPDX 2.0 in favor of using [Section 7](#Relationships-between-SPDX-Elements) which provides more granularity about relationships.

**4.15.1** Purpose: The field provides a place for the SPDX file creator to record a list of other files (referenceable within this SPDX file) which the file is a derivative of and/or depends on for the build (e.g., source file or build script for a binary program or library). The list of files may not necessarily represent the list of all file dependencies, but possibly the ones that impact the licensing and/or may be needed as part of the file distribution obligation.

**4.15.2** Intent: Here, the intent is to provide the recipient of the SPDX file with file dependency information based on the build system that created the file. These other files may impact the licensing of the file and/or may be required to satisfy the distribution obligation of the file (e.g., source files subject to a copyleft license).

**4.15.3** Cardinality: Optional, one or many.

**4.15.4** Data Format: Reference to the file within the SPDX document. For the `tag:value` format, this will be the filename. For the RDF format, it will be a reference to the actual file node.

**4.15.5** Tag: `FileDependency:`

Example:

    FileDependency:./busybox-1.20.2/shell/match.h
    FileDependency:./busybox-1.20.2/shell/match.c

    <File rdf:nodeID="A1">
        <fileName>./package/source2.java</fileName>
    </File>

    <File rdf:nodeID="A3">
      <fileName>./package/source3.java</fileName>
    </File>

    <File rdf:about="...">
        <fileName>./package/mylibrary.jar</fileName>
        <fileDependency rdf:nodeID="A0"/>
        <fileDependency rdf:nodeID="A1"/>
        <fileDependency rdf:nodeID="A2"/>
