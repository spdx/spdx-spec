# Appendix I: SPDX License List

The SPDX License List is a list of commonly found licenses and exceptions used for open source and other collaborative software. The purpose of the SPDX License List is to enable easy and efficient identification of such licenses and exceptions in an SPDX document (or elsewhere). The SPDX License List includes a standardized short identifier, full name for each license, vetted license text, other basic information, and a canonical permanent URL for each license and exception. By providing a short identifier, users can efficiently refer to a license without having to redundantly reproduce the full license. License exceptions can be used with the License Expression Syntax operator, "WITH" to create a license with an exception.

* [License Exceptions][exceptions]: The list of commonly found exceptions to open source licenses, which can be used with the License Expression operator, "WITH" to create a license with an exception.
* [License List Repository][license-list-repo]: The HTML pages you see here are generated from the SPDX license-list-XML Repository. The repository contains XML files for all licenses, deprecated licenses, and license exceptions.
* [Overview][overview]: For general information about the SPDX License List, including principles for inclusion of a license and an explanation of the fields contained on the list.
* [Matching Guidelines][matching]: Guidelines for what constitutes a license match to the SPDX License List. For licenses that include markup, the license text on the HTML pages here will display omitable text in blue and replaceable text in red (see Guideline #2 for more information).
* [Request New License][new-license]: For instructions on how to propose additional licenses or license exceptions be added to the SPDX License List.
