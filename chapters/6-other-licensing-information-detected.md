# 6 Other Licensing Information Detected

This section is used for any detected, declared or concluded licenses that are NOT on the SPDX License List. For the most up-to-date version of the list see: http://spdx.org/licenses/. The SPDX License List can also be found here in [Appendix I](#Appendix-I-SPDX-License-List).

One instance should be created for every unique license or licensing information reference detected in package that does not match one of the licenses on the SPDX License List. Each license instance should have the following fields.

Fields:

## 6.1 License Identifier <a name="6.1"></a>

**6.1.1** Purpose: Provide a locally unique identifier to refer to licenses that are not found on the SPDX License List. This unique identifier can then be used in the packages and files sections of the SPDX file (sections [3](#Package-Information) and [4](#File-Information), respectively).

**6.1.2** Intent: Create a human readable short form license identifier for a license not on the SPDX License List. This identifier should be unique within the SPDX file. In previous versions of SPDX, the references were required to be sequential numbers, but as of version 1.2, creators may specify references that are easier for humans to remember and mentally map.

**6.1.3** Cardinality: Conditional (mandatory, one) if license is not on SPDX License List.

**6.1.4** Data Format: "LicenseRef-"`[idstring]`

where

`[idstring]` is a unique string containing letters, numbers, `.` and/or `-`.

**6.1.5** Tag: `LicenseID:`

Examples:

    LicenseID: LicenseRef-1

    LicenseID: LicenseRef-Beerware-4.2

**6.1.6** RDF: Property `spdx:licenseID` in class `spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo`

    </ExtractedLicensingInfo>

    <ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about="licenseRef-Beerware-4.2">
        <licenseId>LicenseRef-Beerware-4.2</licenseId>
    </ExtractedLicensingInfo>

## 6.2 Extracted Text <a name="6.2"></a>

**6.2.1** Purpose: Provide a copy of the actual text of the license reference extracted from the package or file that is associated with the License Identifier to aid in future analysis.

**6.2.2** Intent: Provide the actual text as found in the package or file for a license that is not on the SPDX License List.

    </ExtractedLicensingInfo>
