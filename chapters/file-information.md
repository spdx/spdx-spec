**Table 36 — Metadata for the file name field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | Yes |
| Cardinality | 1..1 |
| Format | A relative filename with the root of the package archive or directory.<br><br>In general, every filename is preceded with a `./`, see [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) for syntax. |

### 8.1.2 Intent

To aid finding the correct file which corresponds to the file information.

### 8.1.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `FileName:`

```text
FileName: ./package/foo.c
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:fileName` in class `spdx:File`

```text

    ...
</File>
```

## 8.2 File SPDX identifier field <a name="8.2"></a>

### 8.2.1 Description

Uniquely identify any element in an SPDX document which might be referenced by other elements. These might be referenced internally and externally with the addition of the SPDX document identifier. The metadata for the file SPDX identifier field is shown in Table 37.

**Table 37 — Metadata for the file SPDX identifier field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | Yes |
| Cardinality | 1..1 |
| Format | "SPDXRef-"`[idstring]`<br>where `[idstring]` is a unique string containing letters, numbers, `.` and/or `-`. |

### 8.2.2 Intent

There may be several versions of the same file within an SPDX document. Each element needs to be able to be referred to uniquely so that relationships between elements can be clearly articulated.

### 8.2.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `SPDXID:`

```text
SPDXID: SPDXRef-1
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: The URI for the element will follow the form: [SpdxDocumentURI]#SPDXRef-[idstring] where [SpdxDocumentURI] is the URI for the SPDX document containing the element.

Using `xml:base:`

```text
<rdf:RDF xml:base="http://acme.com/spdxdocs/acmeproj/v1.2/1BE2A4FF-5F1A-48D3-8483-28A9B0349A1B"
    ...
    <File rdf:about="#SPDXRef-1">

    </File>
```

Using document URI:

```text
<File rdf:about="http://acme.com/spdxdocs/acmeproj/v1.2/1BE2A4FF-5F1A-48D3-8483-28A9B0349A1B#SPDXRef-1">
    ...
</File>
```

## 8.3 File type field <a name="8.3"></a>

### 8.3.1 Description

This field provides information about the type of file identified. File Type is intrinsic to the file, independent of how the file is being used. A file may have more than one file type assigned to it, however the options to populate this field are limited to:

* `SOURCE` if the file is human readable source code (.c, .html, etc.);
* `BINARY` if the file is a compiled object, target image or binary executable (.o, .a, etc.);
* `ARCHIVE` if the file represents an archive (.tar, .jar, etc.);
* `APPLICATION` if the file is associated with a specific application type (MIME type of application/\*);
* `AUDIO` if the file is associated with an audio file (MIME type of audio/\* , e.g. .mp3);
* `IMAGE` if the file is associated with a picture image file (MIME type of image/\*, e.g., .jpg, .gif);
* `TEXT` if the file is human readable text file (MIME type of text/\*);
* `VIDEO` if the file is associated with a video file type (MIME type of video/\*);
* `DOCUMENTATION` if the file serves as documentation;
* `SPDX` if the file is an SPDX document;
* `OTHER` if the file doesn't fit into the above categories (generated artifacts, data files, etc.)

The metadata for the file type field is shown in Table 38.

**Table 38 — Metadata for the file type field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | No |
| Cardinality | 0..\* |
| Format | `SOURCE` \| `BINARY` \| `ARCHIVE` \| `APPLICATION` \| `AUDIO` \| `IMAGE` \| `TEXT` \| `VIDEO` \| `DOCUMENTATION` \| `SPDX` \| `OTHER` |

### 8.3.2 Intent

Here, this field is a reasonable estimation of the file type, from a developer perspective.

### 8.3.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `FileType:`

```text
FileType: BINARY
```

For a `README.TXT`

```text
FileType: TEXT
FileType: DOCUMENTATION
```

foo.exe

```text
FileType: BINARY
FileType: APPLICATION
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:fileType` in class `spdx:File`

```text
<File rdf:about="file1">
    <fileType rdf:resource="fileType_binary" />
</File>
```

Where file2 is a `README.TXT`

```text
<File rdf:about="file2">
    <fileType rdf:resource
      ="http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#fileType_text" />
    <fileType rdf:resource
      ="http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#fileType_documentation" />
</File>
```

## 8.4 File checksum field <a name="8.4"></a>

### 8.4.1 Description

This field provides the result from some specific checksum algorithm.
Checksum algorithms consume data from the file and produce a short,
fix-sized summary that is sensitive to changes in the file's data.
Any random change to the file's data will (with high likelihood)
result in a different checksum value.

The metadata for the file checksum field is shown in Table 39.

**Table 39 — Metadata for the file checksum field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | Yes |
| Cardinality | 1..1 for the [`SHA1`][SHA-1] algorithm, 0..\* for all other algorithms |
| Algorithm | [`SHA1`][SHA-1] is to be used on the file. Other algorithms that can be provided optionally include [`SHA224`][SHA-224], [`SHA256`][SHA-256], [`SHA384`][SHA-384], [`SHA512`][SHA-512], [`SHA3-256`][SHA3-256], [`SHA3-384`][SHA3-384], [`SHA3-512`][SHA3-512], [`BLAKE2b-256`][BLAKE2b-256], [`BLAKE2b-384`][BLAKE2b-384], [`BLAKE2b-512`][BLAKE2b-512], [`BLAKE3`][BLAKE3], [`MD2`][MD2], [`MD4`][MD4], [`MD5`][MD5], [`MD6`][MD6], [`ADLER32`][ADLER32] |
| Format | In `tag:value` there are three components, an algorithm identifier (SHA1), a separator (“:”) and a checksum value. The RDF shall also contain an algorithm identifier and a checksum value. For example, when the algorithm identifier is SHA1, the checksum value should be a 160-bit value represented as 40 lowercase hexadecimal digits. For other algorithms, an appropriate number of hexadecimal digits is expected. |

### 8.4.2 Intent

Checksum values are used primarily to protect a file's data against
accidental corruption during transmissions or storage.
Cryptographically strong checksum algorithms may be used to detect
deliberate corruption, but only if the authenticity of the checksum
value may be verified.

Checksum values may also be used as an identifier for the file's data
that is (with high likelihood) unique.  Such an identifier may be used
to establish the desired version of a file, if multiple versions are
available.

### 8.4.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `FileChecksum:`

```text
FileChecksum: SHA1: d6a770ba38583ed4bb4525bd96e50461655d2758
```

```text
FileChecksum: MD5: 624c1abb3664f4b35547e7c73864ad24
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:Checksum` in class `spdx:File`

```

## 8.5 Concluded license field <a name="8.5"></a>

### 8.5.1 Description

This field contains the license the SPDX document creator has concluded as governing the file or alternative values if the governing license cannot be determined.

The options to populate this field are limited to:

* A valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Annex [D](SPDX-license-expressions.md);
* `NONE`, if the SPDX document creator concludes there is no license available for this file; or
* `NOASSERTION`, if:

    - the SPDX document creator has attempted to, but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination;
    - the SPDX document creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or
    - the SPDX document creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

If the Concluded License is not the same as the License Information in File, a written explanation should be provided in the Comments on License field ([8.7](#8.7)). With respect to `NOASSERTION`, a written explanation in the Comments on License field ([8.7](#8.7)) is preferred. If the Concluded License field is not present for a file, it implies an equivalent meaning to `NOASSERTION`. The metadata for the concluded license field is shown in Table 40.

**Table 40 — Metadata for the concluded license field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | No |
| Cardinality | 0..1 |
| Format | `<SPDX License Expression>` \| `NONE` \| `NOASSERTION`<br>where:<br>`<SPDX License Expression>` is a valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Annex [D](SPDX-license-expressions.md). |

### 8.5.2 Intent

Here, the intent is for the SPDX document creator to analyze the License Information in File ([8.6](#8.6)) and other objective information, e.g., “COPYING FILE,” along with the results from any scanning tools, to arrive at a reasonably objective conclusion as to what license governs the file.

### 8.5.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `LicenseConcluded:`

```text
LicenseConcluded: LGPL-2.0-only
```

```text
LicenseConcluded: (LGPL-2.0-only OR LicenseRef-2)
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:licenseConcluded` in class `spdx:File`

```text
<File rdf:about="file">
    <licenseConcluded>LGPL-2.0-only</licenseConcluded>
</File>
```

```text
<File rdf:about="...">
    <licenseConcluded>
        <DisjunctiveLicenseSet>
            <member rdf:resource
              ="http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-only"/>
            <member rdf:resource="#LicenseRef-2"/>
        </DisjunctiveLicenseSet>
    </licenseConcluded>
</File>
```

## 8.6 License information in file field <a name="8.6"></a>

### 8.6.1 Description

This field contains the license information actually found in the file, if any. This information is most commonly found in the header of the file, although it might be in other areas of the actual file. Any license information not actually in the file, e.g., “COPYING.txt” file in a top-level directory, should not be reflected in this field.

The options to populate this field are limited to:

* A valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Annex [D](SPDX-license-expressions.md);
* `NONE`, if the file contains no license information whatsoever; or
* `NOASSERTION`, if:

    - the SPDX document creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or
    - the SPDX document creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

If license information for more than one license is contained in the file or if the license information offers the package recipient a choice of licenses, then each of the choices should be listed as a separate entry. If the License Information in File field is not present for a file, it implies an equivalent meaning to `NOASSERTION`. The metadata for the license information in file field is shown in Table 41.

**Table 41 — Metadata for the license information in file field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | No |
| Cardinality | 0..\* |
| Format | `<SPDX License Expression>` \| `NONE` \| `NOASSERTION`<br>where:<br>`<SPDX License Expression>` is a valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Annex [D](SPDX-license-expressions.md). |

### 8.6.2 Intent

Here, the intent is to provide the license information actually in the file, as compared to the Concluded License field.

### 8.6.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `LicenseInfoInFile:`

```text
LicenseInfoInFile: GPL-2.0-only
LicenseInfoInFile: LicenseRef-2

    <licenseInfoInFile rdf:resource="#LicenseRef-2" />
</File>
```

## 8.7 Comments on license field <a name="8.7"></a>

### 8.7.1 Description

This field provides a place for the SPDX document creator to record any relevant background references or analysis that went in to arriving at the Concluded License for a file. If the Concluded License does not match the License Information in File, this should be explained by the SPDX document creator. It is also preferable to include an explanation here when the Concluded License is `NOASSERTION`. The metadata for the comments on license field is shown in Table 42.

**Table 42 — Metadata for the comments on license field**

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | No |
| Cardinality | 0..1 |
| Format | Free form text that can span multiple lines |

### 8.7.2 Intent

Here, the intent is to provide the recipient of the SPDX document with a detailed explanation of how the Concluded License was determined if it does not match the License Information in File, is marked `NOASSERTION`, or other helpful information relevant to determining the license of the file.

### 8.7.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `LicenseComments:`

In `tag:value` format multiple lines are delimited by `<text> .. </text>`.

| Required | No |
| Cardinality | 0..* |
| Format | Reference to the file within the SPDX document. For the `tag:value` format, this will be the filename. For the RDF format, it shall be a reference to the actual file node. |

### 8.16.2 Intent

Here, the intent is to provide the recipient of the SPDX document with file dependency information based on the build system that created the file. These other files might impact the licensing of the file and/or might be required to satisfy the distribution obligation of the file (e.g., source files subject to a copyleft license).

### 8.16.3 Examples

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `FileDependency:`

```text
FileDependency: ./busybox-1.20.2/shell/match.h
FileDependency: ./busybox-1.20.2/shell/match.c
FileDependency: ./busybox-1.20.2/shell/ash.c
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:fileDependency` in class `spdx:File`

```text
<File rdf:nodeID="A0">
    <fileName>./package/source1.java</fileName>
</File>
```

```text
<File rdf:nodeID="A1">
    <fileName>./package/source2.java</fileName>
</File>
```

```text
<File rdf:nodeID="A3">
  <fileName>./package/source3.java</fileName>
</File>
```

```text
<File rdf:about="...">
    <fileName>./package/mylibrary.jar</fileName>
    <fileDependency rdf:nodeID="A0"/>
    <fileDependency rdf:nodeID="A1"/>
    <fileDependency rdf:nodeID="A2"/>
</File>
