</File>
```

## 8.3 File type field <a name="8.3"></a>

**Description**

This field provides information about the type of file identified. File Type is intrinsic to the file, independent of how the file is being used. A file may have more than one file type assigned to it, however the options to populate this field are limited to:

* `SOURCE` if the file is human readable source code (.c, .html, etc.);
* `BINARY` if the file is a compiled object, target image or binary executable (.o, .a, etc.);
* `ARCHIVE` if the file represents an archive (.tar, .jar, etc.);
* `APPLICATION` if the file is associated with a specific application type (MIME type of application/\*);
* `AUDIO` if the file is associated with an audio file (MIME type of audio/* , e.g. .mp3);
* `IMAGE` if the file is associated with an picture image file (MIME type of image/\*, e.g., .jpg, .gif);
* `TEXT` if the file is human readable text file (MIME type of text/\*);
* `VIDEO` if the file is associated with a video file type (MIME type of video/\*);
* `DOCUMENTATION` if the file serves as documentation;
* `SPDX` if the file is an SPDX document;
* `OTHER` if the file doesn't fit into the above categories (generated artifacts, data files, etc.)

**Intent**

Here, this field is a reasonable estimation of the file type, from a developer perspective.

**Metadata**

The metadata for the file type field is shown in Table 38.

**Intent**

Here, by providing a unique identifier of each file, confusion over which version/modification of a specific file should be eliminated.

**Metadata**

The metadata for the file checksum field is shown in Table 39.

Table 39 — Metadata for the file checksum field

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | Yes |
| Cardinality | 1..1 [`SHA1`][SHA-1], others may be optionally provided. |
| Algorithm | [`SHA1`][SHA-1] is to be used on the file. Other algorithms that can be provided optionally include [`SHA224`][SHA-224], [`SHA256`][SHA-256], [`SHA384`][SHA-384], [`SHA512`][SHA-512], [`MD2`][MD2], [`MD4`][MD4], [`MD5`][MD5], [`MD6`][MD6] |
| Format | In `tag:value` there are three components, an algorithm identifier (SHA1), a separator (“:”) and a checksum value. The RDF shall also contain an algorithm identifier and a checksum value. For example, when the algorithm identifier is SHA1, the checksum value should be a 160 bit value represented as 40 lowercase hexadecimal digits. For other algorithms, an appropriate number of hexadecimal digits is expected. |

## 8.5 Concluded license field <a name="8.5"></a>

**Description**

This field contains the license the SPDX file creator has concluded as governing the file or alternative values if the governing license cannot be determined.

The options to populate this field are limited to:

A valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Annex [D](SPDX-license-expressions.md);

`NONE`, if the SPDX file creator concludes there is no license available for this file; or

`NOASSERTION`, if:

- the SPDX file creator has attempted to, but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination;

- the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or

- the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

If the Concluded License is not the same as the License Information in File, a written explanation should be provided in the Comments on License field ([8.7](#8.7)). With respect to `NOASSERTION`, a written explanation in the Comments on License field ([8.7](#8.7)) is preferred.

**Intent**

Here, the intent is for the SPDX file creator to analyze the License Information in File ([8.6](#8.6)) and other objective information, e.g., “COPYING FILE,” along with the results from any scanning tools, to arrive at a reasonably objective conclusion as to what license governs the file.

**Metadata**

The metadata for the concluded license field is shown in Table 40.

Table 40 — Metadata for the concluded license field

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | Yes |
| Cardinality | 1..1 |
| Format | `<SPDX License Expression>` \| `NONE` \| `NOASSERTION`<br>where:<br>`<SPDX License Expression>` is a valid SPDX License Expression as defined in Annex [D](SPDX-license-expressions.md). |

**Examples**

EXAMPLE 1 Tag: `LicenseConcluded:`

```text
LicenseConcluded: LGPL-2.0-only
```

```text
LicenseConcluded: (LGPL-2.0-only OR LicenseRef-2)
```

EXAMPLE 2 RDF: Property `spdx:licenseConcluded` in class `spdx:File`

```text
<File rdf:about="file">
    <licenseConcluded>LGPL-2.0-only</licenseConcluded>
</File>
```

```text
<File rdf:about="...">
    <licenseConcluded>
        <DisjunctiveLicenseSet>
            <member rdf:resource
              ="http://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.0-only"/>
            <member rdf:resource="#LicenseRef-2"/>
        </DisjunctiveLicenseSet>
    </licenseConcluded>
</File>
```

## 8.6 License information in file field <a name="8.6"></a>

**Description**

This field contains the license information actually found in the file, if any. This information is most commonly found in the header of the file, although it might be in other areas of the actual file. Any license information not actually in the file, e.g., “COPYING.txt” file in a top level directory, should not be reflected in this field.

The options to populate this field are limited to:

The SPDX License List short form identifier, if the license is on the SPDX License List;
A reference to the license, denoted by LicenseRef-`[idstring]`, if the license is not on the SPDX License List;

`NONE`, if the file contains no license information whatsoever; or

`NOASSERTION`, if:

- the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or

- the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

If license information for more than one license is contained in the file or if the license information offers the package recipient a choice of licenses, then each of the choices should be listed as a separate entry.

**Intent**

Here, the intent is to provide the license information actually in the file, as compared to the Concluded License field.

**Metadata**

The metadata for the license information in file field is shown in Table 41.

Table 41 — Metadata for the license information in file field

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | Yes |
| Cardinality | 1..* |

    <licenseInfoInFile rdf:resource="#LicenseRef-2" />
</File>
```

## 8.7 Comments on license field <a name="8.7"></a>

**Description**

This field provides a place for the SPDX file creator to record any relevant background references or analysis that went in to arriving at the Concluded License for a file. If the Concluded License does not match the License Information in File, this should be explained by the SPDX file creator. It is also preferable to include an explanation here when the Concluded License is `NOASSERTION`.

**Intent**

Here, the intent is to provide the recipient of the SPDX file with a detailed explanation of how the Concluded License was determined if it does not match the License Information in File, is marked `NOASSERTION`, or other helpful information relevant to determining the license of the file.

**Metadata**

The metadata for the comments on license field is shown in Table 42.

## 8.16 File dependencies field (deprecated) <a name="8.16"></a>

This field is deprecated since SPDX 2.0 in favor of using Clause [11](relationships-between-SPDX-elements.md) which provides more granularity about relationships.

**Description**

The field provides a place for the SPDX file creator to record a list of other files (referenceable within this SPDX file) which the file is a derivative of and/or depends on for the build (e.g., source file or build script for a binary program or library). The list of files might not necessarily represent the list of all file dependencies, but possibly the ones that impact the licensing and/or might be needed as part of the file distribution obligation.

**Intent**

Here, the intent is to provide the recipient of the SPDX file with file dependency information based on the build system that created the file. These other files might impact the licensing of the file and/or might be required to satisfy the distribution obligation of the file (e.g., source files subject to a copyleft license).

**Metadata**

The metadata for the file dependencies field is shown in Table 51.

Table 51 — Metadata for the file dependencies field

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Required | No |
| Cardinality | 0..* |
| Format | Reference to the file within the SPDX document. For the `tag:value` format, this will be the filename. For the RDF format, it shall be a reference to the actual file node. |
