# 3 Package Information{#Package-Information}

One instance of the Package Information is required per package being described. A package can contain sub-packages, but the information in this section is a reference to the entire contents of the package listed. Starting with SPDX 2.0, it is not necessary to have a package wrapping a set of files.

Cardinality: Optional, one or many.

In `tag:value` format, the order in which package and files occur is syntactically significant.

A new Package Information section is denoted by the [Package Name](#section3.1) field.
All Package Information fields must be grouped together before the start of a [Files section](#File-Information), if file(s) are present.
All files contained in a package must immediately follow the applicable Package Information.
A new Package Information section (via Package Name) denotes the start of another package.
Sub-packages should not be nested inside a Package Information section, but should be separate and should use a Relationship to clarify.
Annotations and Relationships for the package may appear after the Package Information before any file information.

Fields:

## 3.1 Package Name <a name="3.1"></a>{#section3.1}

**3.1.1** Purpose: Identify the full name of the package as given by the [Package Originator](#section3.6).

**3.1.2** Intent: The name of each package is an important conventional technical identifier to be maintained for each package.

**3.1.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one.

**3.1.4** Data Format: Single line of text.

**3.1.5** Tag: `PackageName:`

Example:

    PackageName: glibc

**3.1.6** RDF: property `spdx:name` in class `spdx:Package`

Example:

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        <name>glibc</name>
    </Package>

## 3.2 Package SPDX Identifier <a name="3.2"></a>

**3.2.1** Purpose: Uniquely identify any element in an SPDX document which may be referenced by other elements. These may be referenced internally and externally with the addition of the SPDX Document Identifier.

**3.2.2** Intent: There may be several versions of the same package within an SPDX document. Each element needs to be able to be referred to uniquely so that relationships between elements can be clearly articulated.

**3.2.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one.

**3.2.4** Data Format: "SPDXRef-"`[idstring]`

where `[idstring]` is a unique string containing letters, numbers, `.`, and/or `-`.

**3.2.5** Tag: `SPDXID:`

Example:

    SPDXID: SPDXRef-1

**3.2.6** RDF: The URI for the element will follow the form:

    [SPDX DocumentNamespace]#[SPDX Identifier]

See [section 2.5](#section2.5) for the definition of the SPDX Document Namespace and [section 2.3](#section2.3) for the definition of the SPDX Identifier

Example using `xml:base`:

    <rdf:RDF xml:base="http://acme.com/spdxdocs/acmeproj/v1.2/1BE2A4FF-5F1A-48D3-8483-28A9B0349A1B">
        ...
        <Package rdf:ID="SPDXRef-1">
        ...
        </Package>
    </rdf:RDF>

Example using document URI:

    <Package rdf:about="http://acme.com/spdxdocs/acmeproj/v1.2/1BE2A4FF-5F1A-48D3-8483-28A9B0349A1B">
        ...
    </Package>

## 3.3 Package Version <a name="3.3"></a>

**3.3.1** Purpose: Identify the version of the package.

**3.3.2** Intent: The versioning of a package is a useful for identification purposes and for indicating later changes of the package version.

**3.3.3** Cardinality: Optional, one.

**3.3.4** Data Format: Single line of text.

**3.3.5** Tag: `PackageVersion:`

Example:

    PackageVersion: 2.11.1

**3.3.6** RDF: property `spdx:versionInfo` in class `spdx:Package`

Example:

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        ...
        <versionInfo>2.11.1</versionInfo>
        ...
    </Package>

## 3.4 Package File Name <a name="3.4"></a>

**3.4.1** Purpose: Provide the actual file name of the package, or path of the directory being treated as a package. This may include the packaging and compression methods used as part of the file name, if appropriate.

**3.4.2** Intent: The actual file name of the compressed file containing the package may be a significant technical element that needs to be included with each package identification information. If a grouping, like a set of files in a subdirectory, is being treated as a package, the subdirectory name may be appropriate to provide. Subdirectory name is preceeded with a `./`. See [RFC 3986][rfc3986] for syntax.

**3.4.3** Cardinality: Optional, one.

**3.4.4** Data Format: Single line of text.

**3.4.5** Tag: `PackageFileName:`

Example:

    PackageFileName: glibc-2.11.1.tar.gz

Example (subdirectory being treated as a package):

    PackageFileName: ./myrootdir/mysubdir1

**3.4.6** RDF: property `spdx:packageFileName` in class `spdx:Package`

Example:

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        ...
        <packageFileName>glibc 2.11.1.tar.gz</packageFileName>
        ...
    </Package>

Example (subdirectory being treated as a package):

    <Package rdf:about="...">
       ...
       <packageFileName>./myrootdir/mysubdir1</packageFileName>
       ...
    </Package>

## 3.5 Package Supplier <a name="3.5"></a>{#section3.5}

**3.5.1** Purpose: Identify the actual distribution source for the package/directory identified in the SPDX file. This may or may not be different from the originating distribution source for the package. The name of the Package Supplier must be an organization or recognized author and not a web site. For example, [SourceForge][] is a host website, not a supplier, the supplier for https://sourceforge.net/projects/bridge/ is “[The Linux Foundation][LinuxFoundation].”

Use `NOASSERTION` if:

(i) the SPDX file creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination;

(ii) the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or

(iii) the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

**3.5.2** Intent: Assist with understanding the point of distribution for the code in the package. This field is vital for ensuring that downstream package recipients can address any ambiguity or concerns that might arise with the information in the SPDX file or the contents of the package it documents.

**3.5.3** Cardinality: Optional, one.

**3.5.4** Data Format: Single line of text with the following keywords | `NOASSERTION`

* `Person:` person name and optional `(<email>)`
* `Organization:` organization name and optional `(<email>)`

**3.5.5** Tag: `PackageSupplier:`

Example:

    PackageSupplier: Person: Jane Doe (jane.doe@example.com)

**3.5.6** RDF: property `spdx:supplier` in class `spdx:Package`

Example:

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        ...
        <supplier>Person: Jane Doe (jane.doe@example.com)</supplier>
        ...
    </Package>

## 3.6 Package Originator <a name="3.6"></a>{#section3.6}

**3.6.1** Purpose: If the package identified in the SPDX file originated from a different person or organization than identified as Package Supplier (see [section 3.5](#section3.5) above), this field identifies from where or whom the package originally came. In some cases a package may be created and originally distributed by a different third party than the Package Supplier of the package. For example, the SPDX file identifies the package [glibc][] and [Red Hat][RedHat] as the Package Supplier, but the [Free Software Foundation][FSF] is the Package Originator.

Use `NOASSERTION` if:

(i) the SPDX file creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination;

(ii) the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or

(iii) the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

**3.6.2** Intent: Assist with understanding the point of origin of the code in the package. This field is vital for understanding who originally distributed a package and should help in addressing any ambiguity or concerns that might arise with the information in the SPDX file or the contents of the Package it documents.

**3.6.3** Cardinality: Optional, one.

**3.6.4** Data Format: Single line of text with the following keywords | `NOASSERTION`

* `Person:` person name and optional `(<email>)`
* `Organization:` organization name and optional `(<email>)`

**3.6.5** Tag: `PackageOriginator:`

Example:

    PackageOriginator: Organization: ExampleCodeInspect (contact@example.com)

**3.6.6** RDF: property `spdx:originator` in class `spdx:Package`

Example:

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        <originator>Organization: ExampleCodeInspect (contact@example.com)</originator>
    </Package>

## 3.7 Package Download Location <a name="3.7"></a>

**3.7.1** Purpose: This section identifies the download Universal Resource Locator (URL), or a specific location within a version control system (VCS) for the package at the time that the SPDX file was created.

Use:

* `NONE` if there is no download location whatsoever.
* `NOASSERTION` if:

    (i) the SPDX file creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination;

    (ii) the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or

    (iii) the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

**3.7.2** Intent: Where and how to download the exact package being referenced is critical verification and tracking data.

**3.7.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one.

**3.7.4** Data Format: uniform resource locator | VCS location | `NONE` | `NOASSERTION`

For version-controlled files, the VCS location syntax is similar to a URL and has the:

    <vcs_tool>+<transport>://<host_name>[/<path_to_repository>][@<revision_tag_or_branch>][#<sub_path>]

This VCS location compact notation (inspired and mostly adopted from [pip][pip-vcs] as of 2015-02-20) supports referencing locations in version control systems such as [Git][], [Mercurial][], [Subversion][] and [Bazaar][], and specifies the type of VCS tool using url prefixes: `git+`, `hg+`, `bzr+`, `svn+` and specific transport schemes such as SSH or HTTPS.

Specifying sub-paths, branch names, a commit hash, a revision or a tag name is recommended, and supported using the `@` delimiter for commits and the `#` delimiter for sub-paths.

Using user names and password in the `<host_name>` is not supported and should be considered as an error. User access control to URLs or VCS repositories must be handled outside of an SPDX document.

In VCS location compact notations, the trailing slashes in `<host_name>`, `<path_to_repository>` are not significant. Leading and trailing slashes in `<sub_path>` are not significant.

**3.7.5** Tag: `PackageDownloadLocation:`

Examples if ambiguous:

    PackageDownloadLocation: NOASSERTION

    PackageDownloadLocation: NONE

Example for a plain URL:

    PackageDownloadLocation: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc/glibc-ports-2.15.tar.gz

Example for [Git][]:

SPDX supported schemes are: `git`, `git+git`, `git+https`, `git+http`, and `git+ssh`. `git` and `git+git` are equivalent.

Here are the supported forms:

    PackageDownloadLocation: git://git.myproject.org/MyProject

    PackageDownloadLocation: git+https://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git

    PackageDownloadLocation: git+http://git.myproject.org/MyProject

    PackageDownloadLocation: git+ssh://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git

    PackageDownloadLocation: git+git://git.myproject.org/MyProject

    PackageDownloadLocation: git+git@git.myproject.org:MyProject

To specify a sub-path to a file or directory inside a repository use the `#` delimiter:

    PackageDownloadLocation: git://git.myproject.org/MyProject#src/somefile.c

    PackageDownloadLocation: git+https://git.myproject.org/MyProject#src/Class.java

To specify branch names, a commit hash or a tag name, use the `@` delimiter:

    PackageDownloadLocation: git://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git@master

    PackageDownloadLocation: git+https://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git@v1.0

    PackageDownloadLocation: git://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git@da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709

Sub-paths and branch names or commit hash can be combined too:

    PackageDownloadLocation: git+https://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git@master#/src/MyClass.cpp

    PackageDownloadLocation: git+https://git.myproject.org/MyProject@da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709#lib/variable.rb

Example for [Mercurial][]:

SPDX supported schemes are: `hg+http`, `hg+https`, `hg+static-http`, and `hg+ssh`.

The supported forms are:

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+http://hg.myproject.org/MyProject

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+ssh://hg.myproject.org/MyProject

To specify a sub-path to a file or directory inside a repository use the `#` delimiter:

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject#src/somefile.c

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject#src/Class.java

To pass branch names, a commit hash, a tag name or a local branch name use the `@` delimiter:

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@da39a3ee5e6b

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@2019

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@v1.0

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@special_feature

Sub-paths and branch names or commit hash can be combined too:

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@master#/src/MyClass.cpp

    PackageDownloadLocation: hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@da39a3ee5e6b#lib/variable.rb

Example for [Subversion][]:

SPDX supported schemes are: `svn`, `svn+svn`, `svn+http`, `svn+https`, `svn+ssh`. `svn` and `svn+svn` are equivalent.

The supported forms are:

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn://svn.myproject.org/svn/MyProject

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+svn://svn.myproject.org/svn/MyProject

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+http://svn.myproject.org/svn/MyProject/trunk

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+https://svn.myproject.org/svn/MyProject/trunk

To specify a sub-path to a file or directory inside a repository use the `#` delimiter:

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+https://svn.myproject.org/MyProject#src/somefile.c

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+https://svn.myproject.org/MyProject#src/Class.java

This support is less important for SVN since the URL path can also contain sub-paths; this two forms are equivalent:

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+https://svn.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk#src/somefile.c

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+https://svn.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk/src/somefile.c

You can specify a revision using the `@` delimiter:

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+https://svn.myproject.org/svn/MyProject/trunk@2019

Sub-paths and revisions can be combined too:

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+https://svn.myproject.org/MyProject@123#/src/MyClass.cpp

    PackageDownloadLocation: svn+https://svn.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk@1234#lib/variable/variable.rb

Example for [Bazaar][]:

SPDX supported schemes are: `bzr+http`, `bzr+https`, `bzr+ssh`, `bzr+sftp`, `bzr+ftp`, and `bzr+lp`.

The supported forms are:

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+https://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+http://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+sftp://myproject.org/MyProject/trunk

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+ssh://myproject.org/MyProject/trunk

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+ftp://myproject.org/MyProject/trunk

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+lp:MyProject

To specify a sub-path to a file or directory inside a repository use the `#` delimiter:

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+https://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk#src/somefile.c

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+https://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk#src/Class.java

You can specify a revision or tag using the `@` delimiter:

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+https://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk@2019

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+http://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk@v1.0

Sub-paths and revisions can be combined too:

    PackageDownloadLocation: bzr+https://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk@2019#src/somefile.c

**3.7.6** RDF: property `spdx:downloadLocation` in class `spdx:Package`

Example:

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        <downloadLocation>http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc/glibc-ports-2.15.tar.gz</downloadLocation>
    </Package>

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        <downloadLocation>
            git+https://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git@v10.0#src/lib.c
        </downloadLocation>
    </Package>

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        <downloadLocation rdf:resource="http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#noassertion"/>
    </Package>

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        <downloadLocation rdf:resource="http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#none"/>
    </Package>

## 3.8 Files Analyzed <a name="3.8"></a>{#section3.8}

**3.8.1** Purpose: Indicates whether the file content of this package has been available for or subjected to analysis when creating the SPDX document. If `false`, indicates packages that represent metadata or URI references to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component. If `false`, the package must not contain any files.

**3.8.2** Intent: A package can refer to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component that is external to the SPDX document.

Some examples:

A bundle of external products: Package A can be metadata about Packages and their dependencies. It may also be a loosely organized manifest of references to Packages involved in a product or project. Build or execution may transitively discover more Packages and dependencies. All of these referenced Packages can have their own SPDX Documents. In this case, Package A may be defined with its File Analyzed attribute set to `false`. Package A includes External Document References to SPDX documents containing Packages referenced in all the available relationships. The Relationships section then relates the SPDX documents and contained SPDX elements with appropriate semantics per the dependencies in the scope of Package A.
Package relation to external product: Package A can have a STATIC_LINK relationship to Package B, but the binary representation of Package B is furnished by the build process and thus not contained in the file list of Package A. In this case, Package B needs to be defined with its Files Analyzed attribute set to false and all the other attributes subject to the subsequently defined constraints. Then, the relationship between Package A and Package B can be documented as described in [Section 7](#Relationships-between-SPDX-Elements).
File derived from external product: Package A contains multiple files derived from an outside project. Rather than use the `artifactOf*` attributes (Sections 4.9-4.11) to describe the relation of these files to their project, the outside project can be represented by another package, Package B, whose [`FilesAnalyzed`](#section3.8) attribute is set to `false`. Each of the binary files can then have a relationship to package B (Section 6). This allows the outside project to be represented by a single SPDX identifier (the identifier of Package B). It also allows the relationship(s) between the outside project and each of the files be represented in much more detail.

**3.8.3** Cardinality: Optional, one.  If omitted, the default value of `true` is assumed.

**3.8.4** Data Format: Boolean

**3.8.5** Tag: `FilesAnalyzed`

Example:

    FilesAnalyzed: false

**3.8.6** RDF: property `spdx:filesAnalyzed` in class `spdx:Package`

Example:

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        ...
        <filesAnalyzed>false</filesAnalyzed>
        ...
    </Package>

## 3.9 Package Verification Code <a name="3.9"></a>{#section3.9}

**3.9.1** Purpose: This field provides an independently reproducible mechanism identifying specific contents of a package based on the actual files (except the SPDX file itself, if it is included in the package) that make up each package and that correlates to the data in this SPDX file. This identifier enables a recipient to determine if any file in the original package (that the analysis was done on) has been changed and permits inclusion of an SPDX file as part of a package.

**3.9.2** Intent: Provide a unique identifier based on the files inside each package, eliminating confusion over which version or modification of a specific package the SPDX file refers to. This field also permits embedding the SPDX file within the package without altering the identifier.

**3.9.3** Cardinality: Mandatory, one if [`FilesAnalyzed`](#section3.8) is `true` or omitted, zero (must be omitted) if `FilesAnalyzed` is `false`.

**3.9.4** Algorithm:

    verificationcode = 0
    filelist = templist = “”
    for all files in the package {
        if file is an “excludes” file, skip it /* exclude SPDX analysis file(s) */

            append templist with “SHA1(file)/n”
        }
    sort templist in ascending order by SHA1 value
    filelist = templist with "/n"s removed. /* ordered sequence of SHA1 values with no separators */
    verificationcode = SHA1(filelist)

Where SHA1(file) applies a SHA1 algorithm on the contents of file and returns the result in lowercase hexadecimal digits.

Required sort order: '0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','a','b','c','d','e','f' (ASCII order)

**3.9.5** Data Format: single line of text with 160 bit binary represented as 40 lowercase hexadecimal digits

**3.9.6** Tag: `PackageVerificationCode:` (and optionally `(excludes: FileName)`)

`FileName` is specified in [section 4.1](#section4.1).

Example:

    PackageVerificationCode: d6a770ba38583ed4bb4525bd96e50461655d2758 (excludes: ./package.spdx)

**3.9.7** RDF: `spdx:packageVerificationCodeValue`, `spdx:packageVerificationCodeExcludedFile` in class `spdx:PackageVerificationCode` in class `spdx:Package`

Example:

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        <packageVerificationCode>
            <PackageVerificationCode>
                <packageVerificationCodeValue>
                    d6a770ba38583ed4bb4525bd96e50461655d2758
                </packageVerificationCodeValue>
                <packageVerificationCodeExcludedFile>
                    ./package.spdx
                </packageVerificationCodeExcludedFile>
            </PackageVerificationCode>
        </packageVerificationCode>
    </Package>

## 3.10 Package Checksum <a name="3.10"></a>

**3.10.1** Purpose: Provide an independently reproducible mechanism that permits unique identification of a specific package that correlates to the data in this SPDX file. This identifier enables a recipient to determine if any file in the original package has been changed. If the SPDX file is to be included in a package, this value should not be calculated. The [SHA-1][] algorithm will be used to provide the checksum by default. 

**3.10.2** Intent: Eliminate confusion over which version or modification of a specific package the SPDX file references by providing a unique identifier of the package.

**3.10.3** Cardinality: Optional, one or many.

**3.10.4** Algorithms that can be used: [`SHA1`][SHA-1], [`SHA256`][SHA-256], [`MD5`][MD5]

**3.10.5** Data Format: There are three components, an algorithm identifier (e.g. `SHA1`), a colon separator `:`, and a bit value represented as lowercase hexadecimal digits (appropriate as output to the algorithm).

**3.10.6** Tag: `PackageChecksum:`

Example:

    PackageChecksum: SHA1: 85ed0817af83a24ad8da68c2b5094de69833983c

    PackageChecksum: SHA256: 11b6d3ee554eedf79299905a98f9b9a04e498210b59f15094c916c91d150efcd

    PackageChecksum: MD5: 624c1abb3664f4b35547e7c73864ad24

**3.10.7** RDF: properties `spdx:algorithm`, `spdx:checksumValue` in class `spdx:checksum` in class `spdx:Package`

Example:

    <Package rdf:about="...">
        <checksum>
            <Checksum>
                <algorithm rdf:resource="http://spdx.org/rdf/terms#checksumAlgorithm_sha1"/>
                <checksumValue>85ed0817af83a24ad8da68c2b5094de69833983c</checksumValue>

            </Checksum>
        </checksum>
    </Package>

## 3.11 Package Home Page <a name="3.11"></a>

**3.11.1** Purpose: Provide a place for the SPDX file creator to record a web site that serves as the package's home page. This link can also be used to reference further information about the package referenced by the SPDX file creator.

Use:

* `NONE` if there is no package home page whatsoever.
* `NOASSERTION` if:
