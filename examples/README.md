## Examples

All of the examples in this directory are for the same SPDX Document.  Most of the supported document elements are present.

For RDF and JSON, schemas can be found in the schema directory of this repository.

NOTE: The XML format is still a work in progress.  The XML example is intended to be a working document for use by the SPDX team in evaluating the XML format as a candidate for release 3.0.
