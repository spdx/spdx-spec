These are represented by using \"minCount\" and \"maxCount\" respectively. The absolute minimum number of occurrences is zero (0), while for an unbounded maximum number of occurrences a star (*) is being used. Here are some examples: minCount: 1 maxCount: * Cardinality: 0..1 Cardinality: 0..* Cardinality: 1..1 Cardinality: 1..* Each of these assertions can easily be understood as to whether a feature is required, and if so, how many occurrences are required; also, whether a feature is permitted, and if so, in what number. As this is the format long familiar to the SPDX community, it has been preserved in this specification. Introduction to Profiles Profile is the term for a compliance point within the SPDX community across The Linux Foundation and OMG. The System Package Data Exchange (SPDX) specification defines the following six compliance points, defined as \u201cProfiles\u201d: Core and Software Profiles Security Profile Licencing Profile Dataset Profile AI Profile Build Profile Lite Profile Extension Profile The Core Profile is mandatory. All others are optional. Core Profile compliance point The Core Profile includes the definitions of classes properties and vocabularies usable by all SPDX profiles when producing or consuming SPDX content. Although the classes, properties and vocabularies are somewhat extensive, the required fields are rather minimal to allow maximum flexibility while meeting minimum SBOM requirements. Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Core Profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with one of the defined SPDX serialization formats. Conformance to the Core Profile compliance point is mandatory for all other SPDX profiles. This compliance point, in combination with the Software Profile compliance point, provides a baseline of functionality that facilitates interchange of the bills of materials information produced by tools supporting SPDX. Software Profile compliance point The Software Profile includes the definitions of classes, properties and vocabularies for refering to and conveying information about software and is usable by all SPDX profiles when producing or consuming SPDX content. Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Software Profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization formats. Conformance to the Software Profile compliance point does not entail support for the Licencing, Dataset, AI, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles of the SPDX. This compliance point, in combination with the Core Profile compliance point, provides a baseline of functionality that facilitates interchange of the bills of materials information produced by tools supporting SPDX. Security Profile compliance point The Security Profile captures security-related information when producing or consuming SPDX content. Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the security profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization formats, including the properties and relationships specified in the security profile, which are in support of exchanging information about software vulnerabilities that may exist, the severity of those vulnerabilities, and a mechanism to express how a vulnerability may affect a specific software element including if a fix is available. Conformance to the Security Profile compliance point does not entail support for the Licencing, Dataset, AI, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles of the SPDX. This compliance point facilitates interchange of the security information produced by tools supporting SPDX. Licencing Profile compliance point The Licensing Profile includes capturing details relevant to software licensing and intellectual property information when producing or consuming SPDX content. Specifically, software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Licencing profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization formats, including the classes and fields that comprise the SPDX License Expression syntax and that relate to the SPDX License List . There are two associated profiles, the SimpleLicensing Profile and the ExpandedLicensing profiles. Both allow expression of the same information, albeit in different ways. Conformance to the Licencing Profile compliance point does not entail support for the Software, Security, Dataset, AI, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles of the SPDX. This compliance point facilitates interchange of the licencing documents expressing which licenses and copyright notices are determined by persons or automated tooling to apply to distributions of software that are produced by tools supporting SPDX. Dataset Profile compliance point The Dataset Profile captures the relevant information about the datasets used in an AI system or other applications when producing or consuming SPDX content. Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Dataset Profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization formats, including details such as dataset names, versions, sources, associated metadata, licensing information, and any other relevant attributes. The Dataset Profile can covey a description or summary of a dataset, including metadata, characteristics, and statistical information about the data. The Dataset Profile can convey insights into the structure, format, content, and properties of a dataset, helping users understand and analyze the data more effectively. Conformance to the Dataset Profile compliance point does not entail support for the Software, Licencing, Security, AI, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles of the SPDX. This compliance point facilitates interchange of the information about datasets produced by tools supporting SPDX. AI Profile compliance point The AI Profile captures an inventory list of software components and dependencies associated with an AI system when producing or consuming SPDX content. Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the AI Profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization formats, including the information about software components and dependencies associated with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models and systems. This inventory includes the software frameworks, libraries, and other components used to build or deploy the AI system, along with relevant information about their versions, licenses, and useful security references including ethical and security information. Conformance to the AI Profile compliance point does not entail support for the Software, Licencing, Security, Dataset, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles of the SPDX. This compliance point facilitates interchange of the AI model related information produced by tools supporting SPDX. Build Profile compliance point The Build Profile captures build-related information when producing or consuming SPDX content. Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Security Profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization formats, including associated definitions to help express how software is generated and transformed. This includes encoding the inputs, outputs, procedures/instructions, environments and actors from the build process along with the associated evidence. Conformance to the Build Profile compliance point does not entail support for the Software, Licencing, Security, Dataset, AI, Lite, or Extension profiles of the SPDX. This compliance point facilitates interchange of the build information produced by tools supporting SPDX. Lite Profile compliance point The Lite Profile captures the minimum set of information required for license compliance in the software supply chain for producing or consuming SPDX content. Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Security Profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization formats, including creation of the SBOM, package lists with licensing and other related items, and their relationships. Conformance to the Lite Profile compliance point does not entail support for the Software, Licencing, Security, Dataset, AI, Build, or Extension profiles of the SPDX. This compliance point facilitates interchange of minimal licencing information when produced by tools supporting SPDX. Extension Profile compliance point The Extension Profile captures extended tailored information when producing or consuming non-standard SPDX content in three ways: Support Profile-based extended characterization of Elements. Enables specification and expression of Element characterization extensions within any profile and namespace of SPDX without requiring changes to other profiles or namespaces and without requiring local subclassing of remote classes (which could inhibit ecosystem interoperability in some cases). Support extension of SPDX by adopting individuals or communities with Element characterization details uniquely specialized to their particular context. Enables adopting individuals or communities to utilize SPDX expressive capabilities along with expressing more arcane Element characterization details specific to them and not appropriate for standardization across SPDX. Support structured capture of expressive solutions for gaps in SPDX coverage from real-world use. Enables adopting individuals or communities to express Element characterization details they require that are not currently defined in SPDX but likely should be. Enables a practical pipeline that identifies gaps in SPDX that should be filled, expresses solutions to those gaps in a way that allows the identifying adopters to use the extended solutions with SPDX and does not conflict with current SPDX, can be clearly detected among the SPDX content exchange ecosystem, provides a clear and structured definition of gap solution that can be used as submission for revision to the SPDX standard. Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Extension Profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization formats, including the abstract Extension class serving as the base for all defined Extension subclasses. Conformance to the Extension Profile compliance point does not entail support for the Licencing, Security, Dataset, AI, Build, or profiles of the SPDX but is expected to be used in combination with the other profiles to extend them. This compliance point facilitates interchange of extended information that goes beyond the standard SPDX produced by tools supporting SPDX and is used between cooperating parties that understand the form of the extension and can produce and consume its non-standard content.

Software development teams across the globe use the same open source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis activities. As a result, many groups are performing the same work leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information. With this document, the SPDX workgroup, a combined effort of the Linux Foundation SPDX group and the OMG/CISQ Tool-to-Tool effort, has created a data exchange format so that information about software packages and related content may be collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time and improving data accuracy.

That effort actually was the culmination of several earlier attempts to get software transparency, updatability and bill of materials as requirements in safety critical sectors like automotive and healthcare as early as 2013/2014 [2, 3] with many talks and papers written for and against them and discussions. With the launch of the NTIA Software Component Transparency Initiative there was a major increase in the energy and coordination of those proposing software bill of materials (SBOM) as a key element of communication across the different participants in software supply chains. These meetings, which started with a public meeting in Washington DC consisted primarily of vendors of software and customers of those vendors. It was this mix of participants that struck us that these efforts were missing an important community member if they were to make SBOMs successful and useful \u2013 they seemed to be missing the organizations who create the tools for developing software. To address this gap, over the winter and spring of 2019, we crafted a market analysis of the software development tooling ecosystem and documented usage scenarios to drive the functionality needed for an SBOM standard usable by tools to talk to other tools and bring speed and agility into the discussion of software transparency and assurance about the information itself. This information was used to present to the Systems Assurance Platform Task Force (PTF) and the Architecture Driven Modernization PTF in March and June of 2019. The paper \u201cStandardizing SBOM within the SW Development Tooling Ecosystem\u201d, which captured this work, was later published by MITRE [1] and included 8 core usage scenarios for SBOMs as well as a discussion of the various roles were in the software creation tooling ecosystem. This paper and its various pre-publication drafts were used as a discussion starter to garner interest and participation in the Tool-to-Tool (3T) Software Bill of Materials Exchange effort [4]. The 3T-SBOM Exchange effort was co-sponsored by CISQ and OMG and launched in the fall of 2019 with three to four weekly meetings working the various facets of SBOMs. Over the next two years the 3T-SBOM community, which included over 30 organizations that develop and integrate software creation tooling and infrastructure, developed a 3T-SBOM core model (shown in Figure 13) in September of 2020 that had seven basic concepts connected together to address the usage scenarios outlined for the project. Figure 13 \u2013 3T-SBOM draft core model (circa Sep 2020) While the 3T-SBOM community was working to develop their model, the work within the NTIA Software Component Transparency effort also met in numerous weekly virtual meetings to discuss the various aspects of SBOMs, their use, the roles of different players in the lifecycle of an SBOM and the need to educate the world about SBOMs. This was captured in the NTIA Software Bill Of Materials web page. [7] In late 2020 and much of 2021 the world of software security turned its attention to the software supply chain attack on the Solar Winds Corporation [5] and the need to prevent similar types of attacks in the future. The United States Government responded to this and other similar attacks by issuing Executive Order 14028 in May 2021 [12] calling for stronger software security practices for products used by the government and that the software have SBOMs with them. The Executive Order required that \u201cWithin 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information and the Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, shall publish minimum elements for an SBOM.\u201d This was done leveraging the community work that NTIA had been doing with industry for the past 34 months and set the new requirements for SBOM capabilities. [11] Over the 2019-2020 timespan, some of the organization in the 3T-SBOM community were also working within the Linux Foundation\u2019s Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX\u00ae) open-source effort to evolve their previous work. Started in 2010 to help organizations developing software that planned to incorporate open source software make sure that the licenses for that open source software were appropriate for how the organizations planned to use them in their own offerings, the SPDX community developed a series of software products, specifications, and capabilities to address this area. The first published work was a version 1.0 specification in August of 2011; followed by 1.1 version a year later; a 1.2 version in October 2013; a 2.0 version in 2015; and 2.1 version in 2016. The 2.2 version of the specification was published in 2020 to address the required SBOM minimum elements. The 2.2.1 version of SPDX specification was published through the Linux Foundation\u2019s new Joint Development Foundation and sent to ISO under the Publicly Available Standard (PAS) process with it eventually being republished as \u201cISO/IEC 5962:2021 - Information technology \u2014 SPDX\u00ae\u201d in 2021. Through the common members in 3T-SBOM and the Linux Foundation\u2019s SPDX effort many of the concepts around SBOMs flowed back and forth between the two resulting in a draft core model for SPDX 3.0 in September of 2020 that had the same seven basic concepts connected together that were in the 3T-SBOM core model. Figure 14 shows the state of the SPDX 3.0 core model at that time. Figure 14 \u2013 SPDX 3.0 draft core model (circa Sep 2020) The similarities and alignment of the two group\u2019s work (shown in Figure 15 below) was brought to the attention of both teams and after long discussions about each other\u2019s efforts, goals, and approach to creating a standard for today, both agreed in principle to join together under the SPDX 3.0 label but to make several changes in the way the SPDX community activities were run as well as how the resulting specification would be vetted. Figure 15 \u2013 Correspondence between 3T-SBOM and SPDX 3.0 draft models (circa Sep 2020) Specifically, the SPDX community revised their charter to align with the processes of a Standards Development Organization, electing new chairs and adding the OMG Architecture Board review as a gating factor in the publication of SPDX 3.0 and subsequent versions. The merged activities of the two group slid together the beginning weeks of 2021 with activities generally moving forward but occasionally stalling while the larger group worked through issues that one or the other hadn\u2019t discussed or had a different opinion about. Eventually, after releasing SPDX 2.3 in August of 2022 with updates that brought some of the concepts and capabilities slated for SPDX 3.0 to the community in preparation of the shift that SPDX 3.0 represents, the first release candidate of SPDX 3.0 was released in May of 2023. Within the SPDX community, which is both a standards creation organization as well as a community of open source developers, a release candidate offers an opportunity for implementors of SPDX, both new and old, to review the work and determine whether there were parts that were unclear or that would be extremely burdensome to implement. Based on the comments and change requests from the initial candidate release several areas of the model were revised and reworked, resulting in a release candidate 2 of SPDX 3.0 in February of 2024. This release candidate will give tool creators and those who maintain the support libraries for working with SPDX time to start revising their projects in advance of the final version of the specification. For those not following the inner workings, debates, and discussion of the combined 3T-SBOM and SPDX 3.0 working group for the last 3 years there will be a dramatic change in the SPDX model as it goes from SPDX 2.3 to SPDX 3.0, as shown by looking at Figure 16\u2019s left-side (SPDX 2.3 model) compared to its right-side (SPDX 3.0), shifting the SPDX name from Software Package Data Exchange to System Package Data Exchange and the scope of items it can convey in a bill of materials.

History with OMG"},{"location":"omg-history/#history-with-omg-motivation-and-rational-informative","text":"The OMG and CISQ involvement in developing this specification had its start due to a need that came from the several years of work in the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in creating an Initiative to Improve Software Component Transparency in July of 2018 [6]. That effort actually was the culmination of several earlier attempts to get software transparency, updatability and bill of materials as requirements in safety critical sectors like automotive and healthcare as early as 2013/2014 [2, 3] with many talks and papers written for and against them and discussions. With the launch of the NTIA Software Component Transparency Initiative there was a major increase in the energy and coordination of those proposing software bill of materials (SBOM) as a key element of communication across the different participants in software supply chains. These meetings, which started with a public meeting in Washington DC consisted primarily of vendors of software and customers of those vendors. It was this mix of participants that struck us that these efforts were missing an important community member if they were to make SBOMs successful and useful \u2013 they seemed to be missing the organizations who create the tools for developing software. To address this gap, over the winter and spring of 2019, we crafted a market analysis of the software development tooling ecosystem and documented usage scenarios to drive the functionality needed for an SBOM standard usable by tools to talk to other tools and bring speed and agility into the discussion of software transparency and assurance about the information itself.

The data model is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) extensible knowledge representation data model, which provides a flexible and extensible way to represent and exchange information. The data may be serialized in a variety of formats for storage and transmission. RDF serialization Since the data model is based on RDF, any SPDX data can be serialized in any of the multiple RDF serialization formats, including but not limited to: JSON-LD format as defined in JSON-LD 1.1 ; Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) format as defined in RDF 1.1 Turtle ; N-Triples format as defined in RDF 1.1 N-Triples ; and RDF/XML format as defined in RDF 1.1 XML Syntax . The SPDX specification is accompanied by a JSON-LD context definition file that can be used to serialize SPDX in a much simpler and more human-readable JSON-LD format. Canonical serialization Canonical serialization is a single, consistent, normalized, deterministic, and reproducible form. Such a canonical form normalizes things like ordering and formatting. The content of the canonical serialization is exactly the same as the JSON-LD serialization of RDF data (see 4.2), just represented in a consistent way. Canonical serialization is in JSON format, as defined in RFC 8259 (IETF STD 90) , with the following additional characteristics: No line breaks Key names MUST be wrapped in double quotes No whitespace outside of strings true , false and null : the literal names must be lowercase; no other literal names are allowed Integers: represented in base 10 using decimal digits. This designates an integer component that may be prefixed with an optional minus sign. Leading zeros are not allowed. Strings: UTF-8 representation without specific canonicalisation. A string begins and ends with quotation marks (%x22). Any Unicode characters may be placed within the quotation marks, except for the two characters that MUST be escaped by a reverse solidus: quotation mark, reverse solidus, and the control characters (U+0000 through U+001F). Arrays: An array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero or more items. Items are separated by commas. Objects: An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets surrounding zero or more name/value pairs (or members). A name is a string containing only ASCII characters (0x21-0x7F). The names within an object must be unique. A single colon comes after each name, separating the name from the value. A single comma separates a value from a following name. The name/value pairs are ordered by name. Serialization information A collection of elements may be serialized in multiple formats. An SpdxDocument element represents a collection of elements across all serialization data formats within the model. The actual serialized bytes is represented by an Artifact element within the model. A Relationship of type serializedInArtifact links an SpdxDocument to one or more serialized forms of itself. When serializing a physical SpdxDocument, any property of the logical element that can be natively represented within the chosen serialization format (e.g., @context prefixes in JSON-LD instead of the namespaceMap) may utilize these native mechanisms. All remaining properties shall be serialized within the SpdxDocument element itself. A serialization must not contain more than one SpdxDocument. A given instance of serialization must not define more than one SpdxDocument element. Serialization in JSON-LD JSON-LD context file JSON-LD contexts allow JSON documents to use simple, human-readable, locally defined terms while ensuring data interoperability across different systems. The SPDX global JSON-LD context file must be used universally for all SPDX documents in JSON-LD format that adhere to a specific SPDX version. SPDX global JSON-LD context file is available at: https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.1/spdx-context.jsonld All SPDX documents in JSON-LD format must include a reference to the SPDX global context file at the top level. This reference is achieved using the following JSON construct: \"@context\" : \"https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.1/spdx-context.jsonld\" The SPDX context file defines aliases for specific JSON-LD properties to improve compatibility with the SPDX model. These aliases are: spdxId : An alias for the @id property. type : An alias for the @type property. JSON-LD validation An SPDX serialization in JSON-LD format is considered conformant to the SPDX specification if it adheres to the following two validation criteria: Structural validation: The JSON-LD document must structurally validate against the SPDX JSON Schema. This schema defines the expected structure of the JSON-LD document, including the required elements, data types, and permissible values. Semantic validation: The JSON-LD document must successfully validate against the SPDX OWL ontology. This ontology defines the expected relationships and constraints between SPDX elements. The SPDX OWL ontology also incorporates SHACL shape restrictions to further specify these constraints. The SPDX JSON Schema is available at: https://spdx.org/schema/3.0.1/spdx-json-schema.json The SPDX OWL ontology is available at: https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.1/spdx-model.ttl","title":"5.

The present chapter outlines the changes that the current version introduces related to that previous edition.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"annexes/license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/","text":"SPDX License List Matching Guidelines and Templates (Normative) SPDX license list matching guidelines The SPDX License List Matching Guidelines provide guidelines to be used for the purposes of matching licenses and license exceptions against those included on the SPDX License List . There is no intent here to make a judgment or interpretation, but merely to ensure that when one SPDX user identifies a license as \"BSD-3-Clause,\" for example, it is indeed the same license as what someone else identifies as \"BSD-3-Clause\" and the same license as what is listed on the SPDX License List. As noted here, some of the matching guidelines are implemented in the XML files of the SPDX License List repository. How these guidelines are applied Purpose To ensure consistent results by different SPDX document creators when matching license information that will be included in the License Information in File field. SPDX document creators or tools may match on the license or exception text itself, the official license header, or the SPDX License List short identifier. Guideline: official license headers The matching guidelines apply to license and exception text, as well as official license headers. Official license headers are defined by the SPDX License List as specific text specified within the license itself to be put in the header of files. (see explanation of SPDX License List fields for more info). The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <standardLicenseHeader> Substantive text Purpose To ensure that when matching licenses and exceptions to the SPDX License List, there is an appropriate balance between matching against the substantive text and disregarding parts of the text that do not alter the substantive text or legal meaning. Further guidelines of what can be disregarded or considered replaceable for purposes of matching are listed below here and in the subsequent specific guidelines. A conservative approach is taken in regard to rules relating to disregarded or replaceable text. Guideline: verbatim text License and exception text should be the same verbatim text (except for the guidelines stated here). The text should be in the same order, e.g., differently ordered paragraphs would not be considered a match. Guideline: no additional text Matched text should only include that found in the vetted license or exception text. Where a license or exception found includes additional text or clauses, this should not be considered a match. Guideline: replaceable text Some licenses include text that refers to the specific copyright holder or author, yet the rest of the license is exactly the same. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of a specific name in one part of the license resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match to the legally substantive terms (e.g., the third clause and disclaimer in the BSD licenses, or the third, fourth, and fifth clauses of Apache-1.1). In these cases, there should be a positive license match. The text indicated as such can be replaced with similar values (e.g., a different name or generic term; different date) and still be considered a positive match. This rule also applies to text-matching in official license headers (see Guideline: official license headers ). The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline. <alt> with 2 attributes: match - a POSIX extended regular expression (ERE) to match the replaceable text name - an identifier for the variable text unique to the license XML document The original text is enclosed within the beginning and ending alt tags. For example: <alt match=\"(?i:copyright.{0,200}).\" name=\"copyright1\">Copyright The Linux Foundation</alt> The original replaceable text appears on the SPDX License List webpage in red text. Guideline: omittable text Some licenses have text that can simply be ignored. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of certain text that is superfluous or irrelevant in regards to the substantive license text resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match (e.g., directions on how to apply the license or other similar exhibits). In these cases, there should be a positive license match. The license should be considered a match if the text indicated is present and matches OR the text indicated is missing altogether. The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <optional> For example: <optional>Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/</optional> Omittable text appears on the SPDX License List webpage in blue text. Whitespace Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to different spacing of words, line breaks, or paragraphs. Guideline All whitespace should be treated as a single blank space. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. Capitalization Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to lowercase or uppercase letters in otherwise the same words. Guideline All uppercase and lowercase letters should be treated as lowercase letters. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. Punctuation Purpose Because punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence, punctuation needs to be included in the matching process. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline, unless to indicate an exception to the guideline. Guideline: punctuation Punctuation should be matched, unless otherwise stated in these guidelines or unless specific markup is added. Guideline: hyphens, dashes Any hyphen, dash, en dash, em dash, or other variation should be considered equivalent. Guideline: Quotes Any variation of quotations (single, double, curly, etc.) should be considered equivalent. Code Comment Indicators or Separators Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the existence or absence of code comment indicators placed within the license text, e.g., at the start of each line of text, or repetitive characters to establish a separation of text, e.g., --- , === , ___ , or *** . Guideline Any kind of code comment indicator or prefix which occurs at the beginning of each line in a matchable section should be ignored for matching purposes. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. Guideline A non-letter character repeated 3 or more times to establish a visual separation should be ignored for matching purposes. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. Bullets and numbering Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the otherwise same license using bullets instead of numbers, number instead of letter, or no bullets instead of bullet, etc., for a list of clauses. Guideline Where a line starts with a bullet, number, letter, or some form of a list item (determined where list item is followed by a space, then the text of the sentence), ignore the list item for matching purposes. The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <bullet> For example: <bullet>1.0</bullet> Varietal word spelling Purpose English uses different spelling for some words. By identifying the spelling variations for words found or likely to be found in licenses, we avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the same word being spelled differently. This list is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all spelling variations, but meant to capture the words most likely to be found in open source software licenses. Guideline The words in each line of the text file available at the equivalent words list are considered equivalent and interchangeable. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. Copyright symbol Purpose By having a rule regarding the use of \"\u00a9\", \"(c)\", or \"copyright\", we avoid the possibility of a mismatch based on these variations. Guideline \"\u00a9\", \"(c)\", or \"Copyright\" should be considered equivalent and interchangeable. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. The copyright symbol is part of the copyright notice, see implementation of that guideline in Copyright notice . Copyright notice Purpose To avoid a license mismatch merely because the copyright notice (usually found above the actual license or exception text) is different. The copyright notice is important information to be recorded elsewhere in the SPDX document, but for the purposes of matching a license to the SPDX License List, it should be ignored because it is not part of the substantive license text. Guideline Ignore copyright notices. A copyright notice consists of the following elements, for example: \"2012 Copyright, John Doe. All rights reserved.\" or \"(c) 2012 John Doe.\" The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <copyrightText> For example: <copyrightText>Copyright 2022 The Linux Foundation</copyrightText> License name or title Purpose To avoid a license mismatch merely because the name or title of the license is different than how the license is usually referred to or different than the SPDX full name. This also avoids a mismatch if the title or name of the license is simply not included. Guideline Ignore the license name or title for matching purposes, so long as what ignored is the title only and there is no additional substantive text added here. The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <titleText> For example: <titleText>Attribution Assurance License</titleText> Extraneous text at the end of a license Purpose To avoid a license mismatch merely because extraneous text that appears at the end of the terms of a license is different or missing. This also avoids a mismatch if the extraneous text merely serves as a license notice example and includes a specific copyright holder's name. Guideline Ignore any text that occurs after the obvious end of the license and does not include substantive text of the license, for example: text that occurs after a statement such as, \"END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS,\" or an exhibit or appendix that includes an example or instructions on to how to apply the license to your code. Do not apply this guideline or ignore text that is comprised of additional license terms (e.g., permitted additional terms under GPL-3.0, section 7). To implement this guideline, use the <optional> XML element tag as described in Guideline: omittable text . HTTP Protocol Purpose To avoid a license mismatch due to a difference in a hyperlink protocol (e.g. http vs. https). Guideline HTTP:// and HTTPS:// should be considered equivalent. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. SPDX License list Template access The license XML can be accessed in the license-list-data repository under the license-list-XML directory. Although the license list XML files can also be found in the license-list-XML repository, users are encouraged to use the published versions in the license-list-data repository. The license-list-data repository is tagged by release. Only tagged released versions of the license list are considered stable. License List XML format A full schema for the License List XML can be found at SPDX License List XML Schema . Legacy Text Template format Prior to the XML format, a text template was used to express variable and optional text in licenses. This text template is still supported, however, users are encouraged to use the more expressive XML format. A legacy template is composed of text with zero or more rules embedded in it. A rule is a variable section of a license wrapped between double angle brackets <<>> and is composed of 4 fields. Each field is separated with a semi-colon ; . Rules cannot be embedded within other rules. Rule fields begin with a case sensitive tag followed by an equal sign = . Rule fields: type: indicates whether the text is replaceable or omittable as per Substantive text guidelines . Indicated by <<var; . . . >> or Indicated by <<beginOptional; . . .>> and <<endOptional>> respectively. This field is the first field and is required. name: name of the field in the template. This field is unique within each license template. This field is required. original: the original text of the rule. This field is required for a rule type: <<var; . . . >> match: a POSIX extended regular expression (ERE). This field is required for a rule type: <<var; . . . >> The POSIX ERE in the match field has the following restrictions and extensions: Semicolons are escaped with \\; POSIX Bracket Extensions are not allowed For example: <<var;name=organizationClause3;original=the copyright holder;match=.+>>","title":"D.

A package URL or purl is an attempt to standardize existing approaches to reliably identify the location of software packages. A purl is a URL string used to identify the location of a software package in a mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages, package managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases. Such a package URL is useful to reliably reference the same software package using a simple and expressive syntax and conventions based on familiar URLs. Syntax definition purl stands for package URL . A purl is a URL composed of seven components: scheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath Components are separated by a specific character for unambiguous parsing. The definition for each components is: scheme : this is the URL scheme with the constant value of \" pkg \". One of the primary reason for this single scheme is to facilitate the future official registration of the \" pkg \" scheme for package URLs. Required. type : the package type or package protocol such as maven, npm, nuget, gem, pypi, etc. Required. namespace : some name prefix such as a Maven groupid, a Docker image owner, a GitHub user or organization. Optional and type-specific. name : the name of the package. Required. version : the version of the package. Optional. qualifiers : extra qualifying data for a package such as an OS, architecture, a distribution, etc. Optional and type-specific. subpath : extra subpath within a package, relative to the package root. Optional. Components are designed such that they form a hierarchy from the most significant on the left to the least significant components on the right. A purl is a valid URL and URI that conforms to the URL definitions and specifications in RFC 3986 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986 . A purl must not contain a URL Authority i.e. there is no support for username, password, host and port components. A namespace segment may sometimes look like a host but its interpretation is specific to a type. The purl components are mapped to the following URL components: purl scheme: this is a URL scheme with a constant value: pkg purl type, namespace, name and version components: these are collectively mapped to a URL path purl qualifiers: this maps to a URL query purl subpath: this is a URL fragment Character encoding For clarity and simplicity a purl is always an ASCII string. To ensure that there is no ambiguity when parsing a purl , separator characters and non-ASCII characters must be encoded in UTF-8, and then percent-encoded as defined in RFC 3986 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986 . Use these rules for percent-encoding and decoding purl components: the type must NOT be encoded and must NOT contain separators the # , ? , @ and : characters must NOT be encoded when used as separators. They may need to be encoded elsewhere the : scheme and type separator does not need to and must NOT be encoded. It is unambiguous unencoded everywhere the / used as type/namespace/name and subpath segments separator does not need to and must NOT be percent-encoded. It is unambiguous unencoded everywhere the @ version separator must be encoded as %40 elsewhere the ? qualifiers separator must be encoded as %3F elsewhere the = qualifiers key/value separator must NOT be encoded the # subpath separator must be encoded as %23 elsewhere All non-ASCII characters must be encoded as UTF-8 and then percent-encoded It is OK to percent-encode any purl components, except for the type. Producers and consumers of purl data must always percent-decode and percent-encode components and component segments as explained in the \"How to produce and consume purl data\" section. Rules for each component A purl string is an ASCII URL string composed of seven components. Some components are allowed to use other characters beyond ASCII: these components must then be UTF-8-encoded strings and percent-encoded as defined in the \"Character encoding\" section. The rules for each component are: Rules for scheme The scheme is a constant with the value \" pkg \" Since a purl never contains a URL Authority, its scheme must not be suffixed with double slash as in pkg:// and should use instead pkg: . purl parsers must accept URLs such as 'pkg://' and must ignore the '//'. purl builders must not create invalid URLs with such double slash '//'. The scheme is followed by a ':' separator. For example, the two purls pkg:gem/ruby-advisory-db-check@0.12.4 and pkg://gem/ruby-advisory-db-check@0.12.4 are strictly equivalent. The first is in canonical form while the second is an acceptable purl but is an invalid URI/URL per RFC3986. Rules for type The package type is composed only of ASCII letters and numbers, . , + and - (period, plus, and dash). The type cannot start with a number. The type cannot contain spaces. The type must not be percent-encoded. The type is case insensitive, with the canonical form being lowercase. Rules for namespace The optional namespace contains zero or more segments, separated by slash / . Leading and trailing slashes / are not significant and should be stripped in the canonical form. They are not part of the namespace. Each namespace segment must be a percent-encoded string. When percent-decoded, a segment must not contain a slash / and must not be empty. A URL host or Authority must NOT be used as a namespace. Use instead a repository_url qualifier. Note however that for some types, the namespace may look like a host. Rules for name The name is prefixed by a slash / separator when the namespace is not empty. This slash / is not part of the name. A name must be a percent-encoded string. Rules for version The version is prefixed by a at-sign @ separator when not empty. This at-sign @ is not part of the version. A version must be a percent-encoded string. A version is a plain and opaque string. Some package types use versioning conventions such as semver for NPMs or nevra conventions for RPMS. A type may define a procedure to compare and sort versions, but there is no reliable and uniform way to do such comparison consistently. Rules for qualifiers The qualifiers string is prefixed by a ? separator when not empty. This ? is not part of the qualifiers. This is a string composed of zero or more key=value pairs each separated by an ampersand & . A key and value are separated by an equal = character. These & are not part of the key=value pairs. Each key must be unique within the keys of the qualifiers string. A value cannot be an empty string; a key=value pair with an empty value is the same as no key/value at all for this key. Each key must be composed only of ASCII letters and numbers, . , - and \\_ (period, dash and underscore). A key cannot start with a number. A key must NOT be percent-encoded. A key is case insensitive, with the canonical form being lowercase. A key cannot contain spaces. A value must be a percent-encoded string. The = separator is neither part of the key nor of the value. Rules for subpath The subpath string is prefixed by a # separator when not empty. This # is not part of the subpath. The subpath contains zero or more segments, separated by slash / . Leading and trailing slashes / are not significant and should be stripped in the canonical form. Each subpath segment must be a percent-encoded string. When percent-decoded, a segment must not contain a / , must not be any of .. or . , and must not be empty. The subpath must be interpreted as relative to the root of the package. Known types There are several known purl package type definitions. The current list of known types is: alpm , apk , bitbucket , bitnami , cargo , cocoapods , composer , conan , conda , cpan , cran , deb , docker , gem , generic , github , golang , hackage , hex , huggingface , luarocks , maven , mlflow , npm , nuget , oci , pub , pypi , qpkg , rpm , swid , and swift . The list, with definitions for each type, is maintained in the file named PURL-TYPES.rst in the online repository https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec. Known qualifiers key/value pairs Qualifiers should be limited to the bare minimum for proper package identification, to ensure that a purl stays compact and readable in most cases. Separate external attributes stored outside of a purl are the preferred mechanism to convey extra long and optional information. API, database or web form. The following keys are valid for use in all package types: repository_url is an extra URL for an alternative, non-default package repository or registry. The default repository or registry of each type is documented in the \"Known types\" section. download_url is an extra URL for a direct package web download URL. vcs_url is an extra URL for a package version control system URL. file_name is an extra file name of a package archive. checksum is a qualifier for one or more checksums stored as a comma-separated list. Each item in the list is in form of algorithm:hex_value (all lowercase), such as sha1:ad9503c3e994a4f611a4892f2e67ac82df727086 . How to produce and consume purl data The following provides rules to be followed when building or deconstructing purl instances. How to build purl string from its components Building a purl ASCII string works from left to right, from type to subpath. To build a purl string from its components: Start a purl string with the \" pkg: \" scheme as a lowercase ASCII string Append the type string to the purl as a lowercase ASCII string Append / to the purl If the namespace is not empty: Strip the namespace from leading and trailing / Split on / as segments Apply type-specific normalization to each segment, if needed Encode each segment in UTF-8-encoding Percent-encode each segment Join the segments with / Append this to the purl Append / to the purl Strip the name from leading and trailing / Apply type-specific normalization to the name, if needed Encode the name in UTF-8-encoding Percent-encode the name Append the percent-encoded name to the purl If the version is not empty: Append @ to the purl Encode the version in UTF-8-encoding Percent-encode the version Append the percent-encoded version to the purl If the qualifiers are not empty and not composed only of key/value pairs where the value is empty: Append ? to the purl Discard any pair where the value is empty Encode each value in UTF-8-encoding If the key is checksum and there are more than one checksums, join the list with , to create the qualifier value Create each qualifier string by joining the lowercased key, the equal = sign, and the percent-encoded value Sort this list of qualifier strings lexicographically Join this list of sorted qualifier strings with & Append this string to the purl If the subpath is not empty and not composed only of empty, . , and .. segments: Append # to the purl Strip the subpath from leading and trailing / Split the subpath on / as a list of segments Discard empty, . , and .. segments Encode each segment in UTF-8-encoding Percent-encode each segment Join the segments with / Append this string to the purl How to parse a purl string to its components Parsing a purl ASCII string into its components works by splitting the string on different characters. To parse a purl string in its components: Split the purl string once from right on # , if present; the left side is the remainder. If the right side is not empty, it contains subpath information: Strip it from leading and trailing / . Split this on / in a list of segments. Discard empty, . , and .. segments. Percent-decode each segment. UTF-8-decode each of these. Join segments with / . This is the subpath. Split the remainder once from right on ? , if present; the left side is the remainder. If the right side is not empty, it contains qualifiers information: Split it on & in a list of key=value pairs. Split each pair once from left on = in key and value parts. The key is the lowercase left side. Percent-decode the right side. UTF-8-decode this to get the value. Discard any key/value pairs where the value is empty. If the key is checksum , split the value on , to create a list of checksums. This list of keys/values is the qualifiers. Split the remainder once from left on : ; the right side is the remainder. The left side lowercased is the scheme. It should be exactly \" pkg: \". Strip the remainder from leading and trailing / . Split this once from left on / ; the right side is the remainder. The left side lowercased is the type. Split the remainder once from right on @ , if present; the left side is the remainder. If the right side is not empty, it contains version information: Percent-decode the string. UTF-8-decode this. This is the version. Split the remainder once from right on / , if present; the left side is the remainder. The right side contains name information. Percent-decode the name string. UTF-8-decode this. Apply type-specific normalization, if needed. This is the name. If the remainder is not empty, it contains namespace information: Split the remainder on / to a list of segments. Discard any empty segment. Percent-decode each segment. UTF-8-decode each of these. Apply type-specific normalization to each segment, if needed. Join segments with / . This is the namespace.

A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-3-Clause). SPDX License Expressions provide a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef- [idString] ; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g., AND , OR , WITH and + ). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid SPDX License Expression in this section. The exact syntax of license expressions is described below in ABNF, as defined in RFC5234 and expanded in RFC7405 . idstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" ) license-id = <short form license identifier from SPDX License List> license-exception-id = <short form license exception identifier from SPDX License List> license-ref = [%s\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]%s\"LicenseRef-\"(idstring) addition-ref = [%s\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]%s\"AdditionRef-\"(idstring) simple-expression = license-id / license-id\"+\" / license-ref addition-expression = license-exception-id / addition-ref compound-expression = (simple-expression / simple-expression ( %s\"WITH\" / %s\"with\" ) addition-expression / compound-expression ( %s\"AND\" / %s\"and\" ) compound-expression / compound-expression ( %s\"OR\" / %s\"or\" ) compound-expression / \"(\" compound-expression \")\" ) license-expression = (simple-expression / compound-expression) In the following sections we describe in more detail <license-expression> construct, a licensing expression string that enables a more accurate representation of the licensing terms of modern-day software. A valid <license-expression> string consists of either: (i) a simple license expression, such as a single license identifier; or (ii) a more complex expression constructed by combining smaller valid expressions using Boolean license operators. There MUST NOT be white space between a license-id and any following + . This supports easy parsing and backwards compatibility. There MUST be white space on either side of the operator \"WITH\". There MUST be white space and/or parentheses on either side of the operators AND and OR . In the tag:value format, a license expression MUST be on a single line, and MUST NOT include a line break in the middle of the expression. Case sensitivity License expression operators ( AND , and , OR , or , WITH and with ) should be matched in a case-sensitive manner, i.e., letters must be all upper case or all lower case. License identifiers (including license exception identifiers) used in SPDX documents or source code files should be matched in a case-insensitive manner. In other words, MIT , Mit and mIt should all be treated as the same identifier and referring to the same license. However, please be aware that it is often important to match with the case of the canonical identifier on the SPDX License List . This is because the canonical identifier's case is used in the URL of the license's or exception's entry on the List, and because the canonical identifier is translated to a URI in RDF documents. For user defined license identifiers, only the variable part (after LicenseRef- ) is case insensitive. This means, for example, that LicenseRef-Name and LicenseRef-name should be treated as the same identifier and considered to refer to the same license, while licenseref-name is not a valid license identifier. The same applies to AdditionRef- user defined identifiers. Simple license expressions A simple <license-expression> is composed one of the following: An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier. For example: CDDL-1.0 An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier with a unary \"+\" operator suffix to represent the current version of the license or any later version. For example: CDDL-1.0+ An SPDX user defined license reference: [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring) Some examples: LicenseRef-23 LicenseRef-MIT-Style-1 DocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2:LicenseRef-MIT-Style-2 The current set of valid license identifiers can be found in spdx.org/licenses . Composite license expressions Introduction More expressive composite license expressions can be constructed using \"OR\", \"AND\", and \"WITH\" operators similar to constructing mathematical expressions using arithmetic operators. For the tag:value format, any license expression that consists of more than one license identifier and/or LicenseRef, may optionally be encapsulated by parentheses: \"( )\". Nested parentheses can also be used to specify an order of precedence which is discussed in more detail in D.4.5 . Disjunctive \"OR\" operator If presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are valid license expression values. For example, when given a choice between the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT The \"OR\" operator is commutative, meaning that the above expression should be considered equivalent to: MIT OR LGPL-2.1-only An example representing a choice between three different licenses would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT OR BSD-3-Clause It is allowed to use the operator in lower case form or . Conjunctive \"AND\" operator If required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are a valid license expression values. For example, when one is required to comply with both the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT The \"AND\" operator is commutative, meaning that the above expression should be considered equivalent to: MIT AND LGPL-2.1-only An example where all three different licenses apply would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause It is allowed to use the operator in lower case form and . Additive \"WITH\" operator Sometimes license texts are found with additional text, which might or might not modify the original license terms. In this case, use the binary \"WITH\" operator to construct a new license expression to represent the special situation. A valid <license-expression> is where the left operand is a <simple-expression> value and the right operand is a <addition-expression> that represents the additional text. The <addition-expression> can be either a <license-exception-id> from the SPDX License List, or a user defined addition reference in the form [\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]\"AdditonRef-\"(idstring) For example, when the Bison exception is to be applied to GPL-2.0-or-later, the expression would be: GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2 The current set of valid license exceptions identifiers can be found in spdx.org/licenses . It is allowed to use the operator in lower case form with . Order of precedence and parentheses The order of application of the operators in an expression matters (similar to mathematical operators). The default operator order of precedence of a <license-expression> a is: + WITH AND OR where a lower order operator is applied before a higher order operator. For example, the following expression: LGPL-2.1-only OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT represents a license choice between either LGPL-2.1-only and the expression BSD-3-Clause AND MIT because the AND operator takes precedence over (is applied before) the OR operator. When required to express an order of precedence that is different from the default order a <license-expression> can be encapsulated in pairs of parentheses: ( ), to indicate that the operators found inside the parentheses takes precedence over operators outside. This is also similar to the use of parentheses in an algebraic expression e.g., (5+7)/2. For instance, the following expression: MIT AND (LGPL-2.1-or-later OR BSD-3-Clause) states the OR operator should be applied before the AND operator. That is, one should first select between the LGPL-2.1-or-later or the BSD-3-Clause license before applying the MIT license. License expressions in RDF A conjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the conjunctive license.

That is, one should first select between the LGPL-2.1-or-later or the BSD-3-Clause license before applying the MIT license.","title":"Order of precedence and parentheses"},{"location":"annexes/spdx-license-expressions/#license-expressions-in-rdf","text":"A conjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the conjunctive license.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 1) Definitions a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License. c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership. d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License. e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast. f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work. g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium. 2) Fair Dealing Rights . Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws. 3) License Grant . Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\"; c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. e. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes . The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. 4) Restrictions . The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5) Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6) Limitation on Liability . EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7) Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8) Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.","title":"Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported"},{"location":"licenses/CC-BY-3.0/#creative-commons-attribution-license-30-unported","text":"License THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\").

When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5) Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6) Limitation on Liability . EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7) Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8) Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.","title":"Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported"},{"location":"licenses/Community-Spec-1.0/","text":"Community Specification License 1.0 The Purpose of this License.

For details of how NamespaceMap content is to be serialized please refer to the Model and serializations clause and the various serialization format-specific files within the spdx-3-model repository . Namespace maps support a variety of relevant use cases such as: An SPDX content producer wishing to provide clarity of their serialization of an SPDX 2.X simple style collection where all content is newly minted and a single prefix-namespace is used. The consumer of SPDX content wishes to preserve the name space mapping provided by such a producer.
