The data model is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) extensible knowledge representation data model, which provides a flexible and extensible way to represent and exchange information. The data may be serialized in a variety of formats for storage and transmission. 4.2 RDF Serialization Since the data model is based on RDF, any SPDX data can be serialized in any of the multiple RDF serialization formats, including but not limited to: JSON-LD format as defined in JSON-LD 1.1 ; Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) format as defined in RDF 1.1 Turtle ; N-Triples format as defined in RDF 1.1 N-Triples ; and RDF/XML format as defined in RDF 1.1 XML Syntax . The SPDX specification is accompanied by a JSON-LD context definition file that can be used to serialize SPDX in a much simpler and more human-readable JSON-LD format. 4.3 Canonical serialization Canonical serialization is single, consistent, normalized, deterministic, and reproducible form. Such a canonical form normalizes things like ordering and formatting. The content of the canonical serialization is exactly the same as the JSON-LD serialization of RDF data (see 4.2), just represented in a consistent way. Canonical serialization is in JSON format, as defined in RFC 8259 (IETF STD 90), with the following additional characteristics: no line breaks key names MUST be wrapped in double quotes no whitespace outside of strings true, false and null: the literal names must be lowercase; no other literal names are allowed integers: represented in base 10 using decimal digits. This designates an integer component that may be prefixed with an optional minus sign. Leading zeros are not allowed. strings: UTF-8 representation without specific canonicalisation. A string begins and ends with quotation marks (%x22). Any Unicode characters may be placed within the quotation marks, except for the two characters that MUST be escaped by a reverse solidus: quotation mark, reverse solidus, and the control characters (U+0000 through U+001F). arrays: An array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero or more items. Items are separated by commas. objects: An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets surrounding zero or more name/value pairs (or members). A name is a string containing only ASCII characters (0x21-0x7F). The names within an object must be unique. A single colon comes after each name, separating the name from the value. A single comma separates a value from a following name. The name/value pairs are ordered by name. 4.4 Serialization information A collection of elements may be serialized in multiple formats. An SpdxDocument element represents a collection of elements across all serialization data formats within the model. The actual serialized bytes is represented by an Artifact element within the model. A Relationship of type serializedInArtifact links an SpdxDocument to one or more serialized forms of itself. When serializing a physical SpdxDocument, any property of the logical element that can be natively represented within the chosen serialization format (e.g., @context prefixes in JSON-LD instead of the namespaceMap) may utilize these native mechanisms. All remaining properties shall be serialized within the SpdxDocument element itself. A serialization must not contain more than one SpdxDocument. A given instance of serialization must not define more than one SpdxDocument element.","title":"Model and serializations"},{"location":"serializations/#4-model-and-serializations","text":"","title":"4 Model and serializations"},{"location":"serializations/#41-overview","text":"This specification defines the data model of the SPDX standard, describing every piece of information about systems with software components.

A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-3-Clause). SPDX License Expressions provide a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef- [idString] ; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g., AND , OR , WITH and + ). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid SPDX License Expression in this section. The exact syntax of license expressions is described below in ABNF, as defined in RFC5234 and expanded in RFC7405 . idstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" ) license-id = <short form license identifier in Annex A.1> license-exception-id = <short form license exception identifier in Annex A.2> license-ref = [%s\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]%s\"LicenseRef-\"(idstring) addition-ref = [%s\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]%s\"AdditionRef-\"(idstring) simple-expression = license-id / license-id\"+\" / license-ref addition-expression = license-exception-id / addition-ref compound-expression = (simple-expression / simple-expression ( %s\"WITH\" / %s\"with\" ) addition-expression / compound-expression ( %s\"AND\" / %s\"and\" ) compound-expression / compound-expression ( %s\"OR\" / %s\"or\" ) compound-expression / \"(\" compound-expression \")\" ) license-expression = (simple-expression / compound-expression) In the following sections we describe in more detail <license-expression> construct, a licensing expression string that enables a more accurate representation of the licensing terms of modern-day software. A valid <license-expression> string consists of either: (i) a simple license expression, such as a single license identifier; or (ii) a more complex expression constructed by combining smaller valid expressions using Boolean license operators. There MUST NOT be white space between a license-id and any following + . This supports easy parsing and backwards compatibility. There MUST be white space on either side of the operator \"WITH\". There MUST be white space and/or parentheses on either side of the operators AND and OR . In the tag:value format, a license expression MUST be on a single line, and MUST NOT include a line break in the middle of the expression. D.2 Case sensitivity License expression operators ( AND , and , OR , or , WITH and with ) should be matched in a case-sensitive manner, i.e., letters must be all upper case or all lower case. License identifiers (including license exception identifiers) used in SPDX documents or source code files should be matched in a case-insensitive manner. In other words, MIT , Mit and mIt should all be treated as the same identifier and referring to the same license. However, please be aware that it is often important to match with the case of the canonical identifier on the SPDX License List . This is because the canonical identifier's case is used in the URL of the license's or exception's entry on the List, and because the canonical identifier is translated to a URI in RDF documents. For license identifiers, only the variable part (after LicenseRef- ) is case insensitive. This means, for example, that LicenseRef-Name and LicenseRef-name should be treated as the same identifier and considered to refer to the same license, while licenseref-name is not a valid license identifier. The same applies to AdditionRef- . D.3 Simple license expressions A simple <license-expression> is composed one of the following: An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier. For example: CDDL-1.0 An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier with a unary \"+\" operator suffix to represent the current version of the license or any later version. For example: CDDL-1.0+ An SPDX user defined license reference: [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring) Some examples: LicenseRef-23 LicenseRef-MIT-Style-1 DocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2:LicenseRef-MIT-Style-2 The current set of valid license identifiers can be found in spdx.org/licenses . D.4 Composite license expressions D.4.1 Introduction More expressive composite license expressions can be constructed using \"OR\", \"AND\", and \"WITH\" operators similar to constructing mathematical expressions using arithmetic operators. For the tag:value format, any license expression that consists of more than one license identifier and/or LicenseRef, may optionally be encapsulated by parentheses: \"( )\". Nested parentheses can also be used to specify an order of precedence which is discussed in more detail in D.4.5 . D.4.2 Disjunctive \"OR\" operator If presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are valid license expression values. For example, when given a choice between the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT The \"OR\" operator is commutative, meaning that the above expression should be considered equivalent to: MIT OR LGPL-2.1-only An example representing a choice between three different licenses would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT OR BSD-3-Clause It is allowed to use the operator in lower case form or . D.4.3 Conjunctive \"AND\" operator If required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are a valid license expression values. For example, when one is required to comply with both the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT The \"AND\" operator is commutative, meaning that the above expression should be considered equivalent to: MIT AND LGPL-2.1-only An example where all three different licenses apply would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause It is allowed to use the operator in lower case form and . D.4.4 Additive \"WITH\" operator Sometimes license texts are found with additional text, which might or might not modify the original license terms. In this case, use the binary \"WITH\" operator to construct a new license expression to represent the special situation. A valid <license-expression> is where the left operand is a <simple-expression> value and the right operand is a <addition-expression> that represents the additional text. The <addition-expression> can be either a <license-exception-id> from the SPDX License List, or a user defined addition reference in the form [\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]\"AdditonRef-\"(idstring) For example, when the Bison exception is to be applied to GPL-2.0-or-later, the expression would be: GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2 The current set of valid license exceptions identifiers can be found in spdx.org/licenses . It is allowed to use the operator in lower case form with . D.4.5 Order of precedence and parentheses The order of application of the operators in an expression matters (similar to mathematical operators). The default operator order of precedence of a <license-expression> a is: + WITH AND OR where a lower order operator is applied before a higher order operator. For example, the following expression: LGPL-2.1-only OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT represents a license choice between either LGPL-2.1-only and the expression BSD-3-Clause AND MIT because the AND operator takes precedence over (is applied before) the OR operator. When required to express an order of precedence that is different from the default order a <license-expression> can be encapsulated in pairs of parentheses: ( ), to indicate that the operators found inside the parentheses takes precedence over operators outside. This is also similar to the use of parentheses in an algebraic expression e.g., (5+7)/2. For instance, the following expression: MIT AND (LGPL-2.1-or-later OR BSD-3-Clause) states the OR operator should be applied before the AND operator. That is, one should first select between the LGPL-2.1-or-later or the BSD-3-Clause license before applying the MIT license. D.4.6 License expressions in RDF A conjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the conjunctive license. Two or more members are required. <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> <spdx:member rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only\"/> <spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about =\"http://example.org#LicenseRef-EternalSurrender\"> <spdx:extractedText> In exchange for using this software, you agree to give its author all your worldly possessions.

Each structural difference will describe the change, describe an approach to translate from 2.3 to 3.0, and provide a rationale for the change. External Document Reference Description of Change The purpose of the SPDX 2.3 structure \u201cExternalDocumentRef\u201d is now covered by two separate structures: NamespaceMap which maps short identifiers used in serializations to full namespace URI\u2019s to support terseness in serialization of element identifiers ExternalMap which maps an element identifier for an element defined externally to verification and location information The externalDocumentRef property on the SpdxDocument has been replaced by import property and namespace property. Another change is the SPDX document checksum field has been replaced with a \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d property on the ElementCollection. The \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d which has 0 or more \u201cIntegrityMethod\u201d which should be the checksum of the SPDX document. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Each ExternalDocumentRef instance will translate as follows: An entry would be created in the Namespace map for the external document namespace The value of the DocumentRef-[idstring] would be used for the prefix property in the NamespaceMap. The value of the documentNamespace appended with a \u201c#\u201d would be used for the namespace in the NamespaceMap. An entry would be created in the ExternalMap for the external document ref A string identifier consisting of the DocumentRef-[idstring] (the same value as the prefix in the NamespaceMap) concatenated with a \u201c:\u201d and then concatenated with \u201cSPDXRef-DOCUMENT\u201d would be used for the externalSpdxId in the ExternalMap. An integrity method of \u201cHash\u201d will be created with the same information as the checksum property and will be referenced using the \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d property on the ExternalMap entry. An entry would be created in the ExternalMap for each element referenced in the current SpdxDocument that is originally specified in the referenced SpdxDocument. A string identifier consisting of the DocumentRef-[idstring] (the same value as the prefix in the NamespaceMap) concatenated with a \u201c:\u201d and then concatenated with the local portion of the element identifier would be used for the externalSpdxId in the ExternalMap A \u201cdefiningDocument\u201d property would be specified containing a string identifier consisting of the DocumentRef-[idstring] concatenated with a \u201c:\u201d and then concatenated with \u201cSPDXRef-DOCUMENT\u201d. This is a shortcut linkage to tie the referenced element to its defining SpdxDocument for verification and location information. Rationale A key difference between SPDX 2.3 and SPDX 3.0 is that in SPDX 2.3 elements are always expressed within or referenced in relation to a single enclosing SpdxDocument while in SPDX 3.0 a key design principle is that all elements may be expressed and referenced independent of any other element including SpdxDocument. This independence is required to support a variety of content exchange and analysis use cases. For example, in SPDX 2.3 if you wish to express even a single package you specify it within an SpdxDocument and its identifier namespace is restricted to the namespace of the SpdxDocument. In SPDX 3.0 you could specify a single package within an SpdxDocument element (or any other subclass of ElementCollection such as Bundle, Bom, Sbom, etc.) but you could also simply specify it on its own without any enclosing collection element. In addition, in SPDX 3.0 the identifier of the package may share a namespace with an enclosing collection element such as SpdxDocument if desired but it is equally valid for it to have any namespace desired unconstrained by any other element namespace whether it is expressed within a collection element such as SpdxDocument or not. In this example, in SPDX 2.3 if you referenced the package within the same SpdxDocument that it is defined in you would utilize the local portion of its identifier and presume that the namespace is the same as the SpdxDocument namespace. If you referenced it from an SpdxDocument other than the one it is defined in you would use an ExternalDocumentRef to specify a prefix name for the other SpdxDocument to be used within the current SpdxDocument, the URI namespace/identifier for the other SpdxDocument, and a checksum for the other SpdxDocument. To reference the package you would then use an identifier combining the external document ref prefix and the local portion of the identifier. The ExternalDocumentRef structure in SPDX 2.3 is based on the presumptions that elements are always defined within SpdxDocuments, that external elements can always be referenced via a containing SpdxDocument and that element identifiers have a namespace from their original containing SpdxDocument. None of these three presumptions hold true for SPDX 3.0 so a slightly modified structure is necessary to support the two use cases previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef in SPDX 2.3: 1) the ability to specify identifier namespace prefixes and accompanying namespaces for SPDX elements to support more terse serialized expression of content with integrity across serialization forms, 2) the ability to specify which elements in the current subclass of ElementCollection (e.g., SpdxDocument) are only referenced from that collection and defined elsewhere, along with details regarding their verification and location. The Namespace map structure in SPDX 3.0 fully supports the namespace prefixing use case for SpdxDocuments previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef but also equally covers the same use case capability for all element types and for any number of element identifier namespaces (in SPDX 3.0 all elements within an SpdxDocument are not required to have the same namespace and can actually be any desired mix of namespaces) to support this capability required in SPDX 3.0. The ExternalMap structure in SPDX 3.0 fully supports the external element (including SpdxDocument elements) referencing use case for SpdxDocuments previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef but also equally covers the same use case capability for any elements whether they were originally defined within an SpdxDocument or not to support this capability required in SPDX 3.0. The ExternalMap structure in SPDX 3.0 provides the ability to specify verification and location details for any element, not just SpdxDocuments, if appropriate but also provides simple linkage, using the \u201cdefiningDocument'' property, from element entries in the ExternalMap to SpdxDocument entries in the ExternalMap where the elements were defined within the SpdxDocument and verification of the elements can be achieved via proxy to the SpdxDocument \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d information (this is how the SPDX 2.3 ExternalDocumentRef structure currently works). Agent Description of Change The creator property in SPDX 2.3 has been replaced by createdBy and createdUsing properties with a type Agent and Tool resp. The supplier property has been replaced by a property suppliedBy with a type Agent. Additional suppliers can be provided with a a relationship to an availableFrom relationship. The originator property type has been replaced with the originatedBy property with a type Agent. An Agent can be a Person, Organization, or Software Agent. It can also just be an Agent if it is not known what specific type an Agent is. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 The SPDX 2.3 creator string would be parsed and the appropriate Person, Organization or Tool would be created depending on if the prefix is \u201cPerson: \u201d, \u201cOrganization:\u201d or \u201cTool: \u201d resp. The required createdBy field for Agent or Tool may point to itself if no other information is available. The createdUsing property would be used for Tool whereas the createdBy property would be used for Person and Organization. The name would map to the \u201cname\u201d property. If an email address is present, it would translate to an external identifier. Note that in 3.0 the createdBy is a required field. There will be situations where only a Tool is provided. In that case, createdBy should point to a SoftwareAgent should be created using the same information as the Tool. Rationale The 3.0 format is more machine readable and structured (e.g. you do not need to parse the type from the string value). It is also more flexible in that an Agent can be used even if it is not known what the Agent type is. File Type Description of Change The FileType enumeration has been replaced by two fields, the media type string as maintained by IANA for the content of the file and an enumeration of SoftwarePurpose for the purpose of the file. The property name fileType has been replaced by a property name contentType. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Rationale One of the things that we identified is that FileType was being used for two things: Describing the purpose of the file. Describing the type of content in the file. For SPDX 3.0 we split this into two properties: SoftwarePurpose to capture the purpose (which is of type SoftwarePurpose ). ContentType to capture the type of content (which is of type MediaType ). The name ContentType was chosen to mirror the Content-Type header in HTTP (which is also of type MediaType) and to express that this is describing the type of content (as opposed to metadata, headers, or something else). For example, if (and not saying we would) we extended File in the future to be able to capture the type of executable header a file has (e.g. ELF), that could also be of type MediaType but the property name might be ExecutableHeaderType . An example conversion table from SPDX 2.3 FileType to SPDX 3.0 ContentType or SoftwarePurpose can look like this: SPDX 2 File Type SPDX 3 Software Purpose SPDX 3 Content Type ARCHIVE Archive BINARY application/octet-stream SOURCE Source TEXT text/plain APPLICATION Application AUDIO audio/* IMAGE image/* VIDEO video/* DOCUMENTATION Documentation SPDX text/spdx OTHER Other Package File Name Description of Change The packageFileName property and packageChecksum property has been replaced by a relationship from a Package to a File. A relationship type of hasDistributionArtifact should be used. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Create an SPDX File with the name from the packageFileName and a verifiedUsing value from the packageChecksum for a single file. If the packageFileName is a directory, then the SPDX File is created with the directory name and is verified using the contentIdentifier property on the File and a fileKind of directory. Create a hasDistributionArifact relationship from the SPDX Package to the SPDX File. Rationale Providing a File relationship to the download location will include more detailed and complete information about the package file name used. External Identifiers Description of Change In SPDX 3.0, a properties externalIdentifier and contentIdentifier with types ExternalIdentifier and ContentIdentifier were introduced. This is in addition to retaining the ExternalRef property and classes. In SPDX 2.3, both identifiers and references were captured in the externalRef property for packages. In addition to the structural changes, the \u201curl\u201d ExternalRef type was removed and is replaced by the \u201csecurityOther\u201d ExternalRef type. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 The following ExternalRef Types should be converted to ExternalIdentifiers: cpe22Type cpe23Type swid purl The following ExternalRef Types should be converted to ContentIdentifers: gitoid swh All other ExternalRef types should remain as ExternalRef\u2019s. The url ExternalRef type should be converted to a \u201csecurityOther\u201d. Rationale Distinguishing identifiers from references is key to several integrity and provenance use cases. Creating a separate property and type enables easier identification of identifiers. Package URL Description of Change In SPDX 3.0, Package URL is a new property for Artifact which is a superclass of Package. Package URL is an External Ref type in SPDX 2.3. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 If there is a single ExternalReference of type purl without the optional ExternalRef comment property, place that in the packageUrl property. Rationale Package URL is a very common method of identifying software packages. Moving this to a property makes it significantly simpler to find and correlate Package URL identifiers. Annotation Description of Change Annotations are now subclasses of Element, so it inherits a number of new optional properties including names, annotations, and its own relationships. Annotations are no longer a property of an Element. It is now a standalone element with a \u201csubject\u201d field which points to the Element being annotated. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 A new Annotation element would be created for every annotation property in an element (Package, File or Snippet). The subject property would point to the Element which has the Annotation as a property. The annotator from SPDX 2.3 should be translated to one of the creators for the creationInfo for the Annotation and the annotationDate should be translated to the created field in the same creationInfo. The creationInfo for the Annotation should be the creationInfo of the SPDX 2.3 document. The SPDX 2.3 \u201ccomment\u201d should use the statement field in SPDX 3.0. Rationale Changing from a property to a standalone element allows for relationships to exist outside the element itself (e.g. you can now create an amended SPDX document which has a new annotation for an element defined in the original document). This also supports third parties' ability to assert Annotations on Elements that they did not create. Relationship Description of Change The structure of the Relationship class has changed to have a single direction and allow more than one related SPDX Elements. Relationships are now subclasses of Element, so it inherits a number of new optional properties including names, annotations, and its own relationships. Relationships are no longer a property of an Element. It is now a standalone element with a \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d field. A new property \u201ccompleteness' ' complements the use of NONE and NOASSERTION for the related SPDX elements. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 The \u201cfrom\u201d property would be populated by the SPDX Element which has the relationship property. The \u201cto\u201d property will be the relatedSpdxElement. When translating the relationshipType, the \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d may need to be swapped - the table below will have a \u201cY\u201d in the \u201cSwap to and from?\u201d column when this is necessary. The completeness property would be constructed based on the following: \u201cto\u201d value is NONE: complete \u201cto\u201d value is NOASSERTION: noAssertion \u201cto\u201d value is an SPDX element: No value for the completeness - uses the default The following table reflects the translation for relationship types from SPDX 2.3 to SPDX 3.0: SPDX 2.3 Relationship Type SPDX 3.0 Relationship Type Swap to and from?

Changing from a property to a standalone element allows for relationships to exist outside the element itself (e.g. you can now create an amended SPDX document which has a new relationship for an element defined in the original document). This enables primary Element creating parties as well as third parties to express significantly greater contextual detail among content they create as well as content created by others. Snippet Description of Change Byte and line range types have been changed from a StartEndPointer type to a PositiveIntegerRange. Byte range is now optional. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Iterate through the \u201cranges\u201d property. Any startPointer and endPointer with a property of \u201coffset\u201d would be translated to a snippetByteRange property. Any startPointer and endPointer with a property of \u201clineNumber\u201d would translate to a snippetLineRange property. A new Relationship would be created with the \u201cfrom\u201d pointing to the snippetFromFile and the \u201cto\u201d pointing to the Snippet. They relationshipType would be CONTAINS. Rationale Using the W3C Pointer standard introduced significant complexity in the SPDX 2.X specification. Although there may be some benefit in using a published standard, we have not found any instances where the W3C Pointer ontology was useful for SPDX use cases. Changing the snippetFromFile from a property to a relationship [to be filled in]. SpecVersion Description of Change The type of SpecVersion is changed from a simple string without constraints to a SemVer string which must follow the Semantic Versioning format . This adds a constraint where a patch version is required. Previous usage of the SpecVersiononly included the major and minor version. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Add a patch version of \u201c0\u201d to any previous spec version. Rationale The additional constraints align with best practices for versioning strings LicenseListVersion Description of Change The type of LicenseListVersion is changed from a simple string without constraints to a SemVer string which must follow the Semantic Versioning format . This adds a constraint where a patch version is required. Previous usage of the SPDX license list only included the major and minor version. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Add a patch version of \u201c0\u201d to any previous license list version. Rationale The additional constraints align with best practices for versioning strings. Properties Removed Below is a list of properties present in 2.3 and not present in 3.0. The Range / Where used is where the property was used in the SPDX 2.3 model. example SPDX 2.3 Model Name example Tag/Value Name Not used Range / Where Used LicenseException Rationale This field has not been used. LicenseInfoInFiles SPDX 2.3 Model Name licenseInfoInFiles Tag/Value Name LicenseInfoInFiles Range / Where Used Package Rationale This field is redundant with the declaredLicense property in the Files contained in the Package. It is recommended that the licenseInfoInFiles can be added as an Annotation to the Package in the format: \u201cSPDX 2.X LicenseInfoInFiles: [expression1], [expression2]\u201d where the [expressions] are the string representation of the license expressions. FilesAnalyzed SPDX 2.3 Model Name filesAnalyzed Tag/Value Name FilesAnalyzed Range / Where Used Package Rationale Many users of the SPDX 2.X spec reported this property as very confusing. NOTE: There is no longer a way to specific checksums are required for files. This is being tracked in Issue #84 . Naming Differences Below is a list of properties and classes where the name has been changed from 2.3 to 3.0. The Range / Where used is where the property was used in the SPDX 2.3 model. Release Date SPDX 2.3 Model Name releaseDate Tag/Value Name ReleaseDate New Name releaseTime Range / Where Used Package Rationale Better reflects the granularity of the field. Build Date SPDX 2.3 Model Name buildDate Tag/Value Name BuildDate New Name buildTime Range / Where Used Package Rationale Better reflects the granularity of the field. Valid Until Date SPDX 2.3 Model Name validUntilDate Tag/Value Name ValidUntilDate New Name validUntilTime Range / Where Used Package Rationale Better reflects the granularity of the field. External Document Reference SPDX 2.3 Model Name externalDocumentRef Tag/Value Name ExternalDocumentRef New Name import Range / Where Used SpdxDocument (Creation Information) Rationale Feedback from SPDX 2.X usage is that externalDocumentRef is confusing due to the similar externalRef property. NOTE: See structural changes related to this property Checksum Class / Data Type SPDX 2.3 Model Name Checksum class name and checksum property name Tag/Value Name FileChecksum, PackageChecksum New Name verifiedUsing property and Hash class Range / Where Used Package, File Rationale More general concept allowing for different verification algorithms for different scenarios. Checksum Algorithm SPDX 2.3 Model Name checksumAlgorithm Tag/Value Name N/A - parsed from a string following the Checksum: keyword. New Name hashAlgorithm Range / Where Used Package, File Rationale The term \u201chash\u201d better represents the intent of this property which is to validate the integrity of the data whereas the term \u201cchecksum\u201d is typically for the purpose of error checking. Name SPDX 2.3 Model Name packageName, fileName Tag/Value Name PackageName, FileName New Name name Range / Where Used Package, File Rationale In the SPDX 2.3 RDF Ontology, both spdx:fileName and spdx:packageName are sub-properties of spdx:name. The OWL has a restriction that spdx:File has exactly one spdx:fileName and spdx:Package has exactly one spdx:packageName. Changing these restrictions to just spdx:name would simplify the model. Version SPDX 2.3 Model Name versionInfo Tag/Value Name PackageVersion New Name packageVersion Range / Where Used Package Rationale This change would make the Tag/Value and RDF values consistent. Home Page SPDX 2.3 Model Name doap:homepage Tag/Value Name PackageHomePage New Name homePage Range / Where Used Rationale Uses a consistent namespace for SPDX properties. Annotation Comment SPDX 2.3 Model Name rdfs:comment Tag/Value Name AnnotationComment New Name statement Range / Where Used Element (Package, File, Snippet) Rationale The rdfs:comment property is optional and has slightly different semantics in other uses (e.g. comments on Elements). Changing the property name clearly distinguishes this usage as a mandatory property for an Annotation. With Exception Operator SPDX 2.3 Model Name WithExceptionOperator member property in WithExceptionOperator licenseException property in WithExceptionOperator Tag/Value Name With (part of License Expression) New Name WithAdditionOperator subjectLicense subjectAddition Range / Where Used Package, File, Snippet Rationale Custom Additions have been added in SPDX 3.0 which operate in a similar manner to listed License Exceptions. The new type and property names are more general to accommodate both custom additions and listed license Exceptions. License Exception SPDX 2.3 Model Name LicenseException licenseExceptionId property in LicenseException licenseExceptionText property in LicenseException name property in LicenseException Tag/Value Name Not used in Tag/Value New Name ListedLicenseException additionId additionText additionName Range / Where Used Package, File, Snippet Rationale Custom Additions have been added in SPDX 3.0 which operate in a similar manner to listed License Exceptions. The new type and property names are more general to accommodate both custom additions and listed license Exceptions. ExtractedLicenseInfo SPDX 2.3 Model Name ExtractedLicenseInfo Tag/Value Name ExtractedText New Name CustomLicense Range / Where Used Package, File, Snippet, Document Rationale The SPDX 2.X term implied that the only property was text when in fact there are several properties in common with the listed licenses. See model issue #233 for context. licenseComment SPDX 2.3 Model Name licenseComment Tag/Value Name LicenseName New Name name Range / Where Used License, ListedLicense, ExtractedText Rationale \u201cname\u201d is used in the Element class. Since License is a type of (subclass of) Element, it should use the same field otherwise there would be redundant fields for the same purpose. LicenseComment SPDX 2.3 Model Name licenseComment Tag/Value Name LicenseComment New Name comment Range / Where Used License, ListedLicense Rationale \u201ccomment\u201d is used in the Element class. Since License is a type of (subclass of) Element, it should use the same field otherwise there would be redundant fields for the same purpose. LicenseID SPDX 2.3 Model Name licenseId Tag/Value Name LicenseId New Name spdxId Range / Where Used License, ListedLicense Rationale \u201cspdxId\u201d is used in the Element class. Since License is a type of (subclass of) Element, it should use the same field otherwise there would be redundant fields for the same purpose. Range / Where Used License, ListedLicense Rationale Primary Package Purpose SPDX 2.3 Model Name primaryPackagePurpose Tag/Value Name PrimaryPackagePurpose New Name primaryPurpose Range / Where Used Package Rationale The purpose property is now available for files and snippets in addition to Package resulting in a more general name of primaryPurpose. Note that additional purposes can be added using the additionalPurpose property. Serialization Formats SPDX 3.0 implements a JSON-LD format which has consistent class and property names with the model. See the SPDX 3.0 JSON Schema for the format specifics. The Tag/Value, YAML, RDF/XML and Spreadsheet formats are not supported. Additional serialization formats are being considered for the SPDX 3.1 release. A.2 Differences between V2.3 and V2.2.2 V2.3 has added new fields to improve the ability to capture security related information and to improve interoperability with other SBOM formats. Key changes include: Added fields to Clause 7 ( Package Information ) to describe \"Primary Package Purpose\" and standardize recording of \"Built Date\", \"Release Date\", \"Valid Until Date\". Added hash algorithms (SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, BLAKE2b-256, BLAKE2b-384, BLAKE2b-512, BLAKE3, ADLER32 ) to the set recognized by 7.10 (Package Checksum field) and 8.4 (File checksum field) Update Clause 7, 8, and 9 to make several of the licensing properties optional rather than requiring the use of \"NOASSERTION\" when no value is provided. Update Clause 11 to add the new relationship types: REQUIREMENT_DESCRIPTION_FOR and SPECIFICATION_FOR. Update Annex B ( License matching guidelines and templates ) to use the License List XML format Update Annex F ( External Repository Identifiers ) to expand security references to include advisory, fix, URL, SWID. Expand persistent identifiers to include gitoid. Update Annex G ( SPDX Lite Profile ) to include NTIA SBOM mandatory minimum fields as required. Update Annex H to documented how the snippet information in files to be consistent with REUSE recommendations. Added Annex K ( How To Use SPDX in Different Scenarios ) to illustrate linking to external security information, and illustrate how the NTIA SBOM mandatory minimum elements map to SPDX fields. A.3 Differences between V2.2.2 and V2.2.1 V2.2.2 fixed formatting, grammatical and spelling issues found since ISO/IEC 5962:2021 SPDX v2.2.1 was published. No new fields were added. Key changes include: Clarify Optional Cardinality contradictions Update OWL document Update JSON schema to fix typos and add missing required fields. Clarify Information on using License List short form identifiers. It fixed annex lettering inconsistencies. It also moved CC-BY-3.0 to the end of the spec to keep annex letters more consistent in future versions. Here is the translation between lettering in V2.2.2 and the version that came before it: Table A.1 \u2014 SPDX V2.2.2 Organizational Changes Title V2.2.1 ( spdx.dev ) V2.2.1 (ISO) V2.2.2 SPDX Lite Annex H/G* Annex G Annex G SPDX File Tags Annex I/H* Annex H Annex H Differences from Earlier SPDX Versions Annex J/I* Annex I Annex I Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported Annex G [omitted] Annex J [omitted in ISO version] * This edition featured inconsistent lettering. A.4 Differences between V2.2.1 and V2.2 There were no technical differences; V2.2.1 is V2.2 reformatted for submission to ISO via the PAS process. As a result, new clauses were added causing the previous clause-numbering sequence to change. Also, Annexes went from having Roman numbers to Latin letters. Here is the translation between numbering in V2.2.1 and the version that came before it: Table A.2 \u2014 SPDX V2.2.1 Organizational Changes Title V2.2 V2.2.1 ( spdx.dev ) V2.2.1 (ISO) Scope N/A Clause 1 Clause 1 Normative references N/A Clause 2 Clause 2 Terms and definitions N/A Clause 3 Clause 3 Conformance N/A Clause 4 Clause 4 Composition of an SPDX document N/A Clause 5 Clause 5 Document Creation Information Chapter 2 Clause 6 Clause 6 Package Information Chapter 3 Clause 7 Clause 7 File Information Chapter 4 Clause 8 Clause 8 Snippet Information Chapter 5 Clause 9 Clause 9 Other Licensing Information Detected Chapter 6 Clause 10 Clause 1 Relationship between SPDX Elements Information Chapter 7 Clause 11 Clause 1 Annotation Information Chapter 8 Clause 12 Clause 1 Review Information (deprecated) Chapter 9 Clause 13 Clause 1 SPDX License List Appendix I Annex A Annex A License Matching Guidelines and Templates Appendix II Annex B Annex B RDF Object Model and Identifier Syntax Appendix III Annex C Annex C SPDX License Expressions Appendix IV Annex D Annex D Using SPDX short identifiers in Source Files Appendix V Annex E Annex E External Repository Identifiers Appendix VI Annex F Annex F Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported Appendix VII Annex G [omitted] SPDX Lite Appendix VIII Annex H/G* Annex G SPDX File Tags Appendix IX Annex I/H* Annex H Differences from Earlier SPDX Versions N/A Annex J/I* Annex I * This edition featured inconsistent lettering. A.5 Differences from V2.2 and V2.1 JSON, YAML, and a development version of XML have been added as supported file formats. A new appendix \"SPDX File Tags\" has been added to describe a method that developers can use to document other SPDX file-specific information (such as copyright notices, file type, etc.) in a standardized and easily machine-readable manner. See Appendix IX for more information. A new appendix \"SPDX Lite\" has been added to document a lightweight subset of the SPDX specification for scenarios where a full SPDX document is not required. See Appendix VIII for more information. Additional relationship options have been added to enable expression of different forms of dependencies between SPDX elements. As well, NONE and NOASSERTION keywords are now permitted to be used with relationships to indicate what is unknown. Miscellaneous bug fixes and non-breaking improvements as reported on the mailing list and reported as issues on the spdx-spec GitHub repository. A.6 Differences between V2.1 and V2.0 Snippets have been added to allow a portion of a file to be identified as having different properties from the file it resides in. The use of snippets is completely optional and it is not mandatory for snippets to be identified. See section 5 Snippet Information for further details on the fields available to describe snippets. External Packages can now be referred to in SPDX documents. When there is no SPDX file information available to document the content of these external packages, then the filesAnalyzed attribute on a package should be set to false. See section 3.8 Files Analyzed for more information. Packages are now able to associate with an \u201cExternal Reference\u201d which allows a Package to reference an external source of additional information, metadata, enumerations, asset identifiers, or downloadable content believed to be relevant to the Package. See: section 3.21 External Reference, 3.22 External Reference Comment and Appendix VI: External Repository Identifiers for more information. The \u201cArtifact of Project\u201d fields at the file level are now deprecated, as they can be replaced by a relationship to the more descriptive External Packages. A new appendix \u201cUsing SPDX short identifiers in Source Files\u201d has been added to document the best practices to refer to the licenses in the SPDX license list that have emerged from the development community. See Appendix V: Using SPDX short identifiers in Source Files for more information. Miscellaneous bug fixes. A.7 Differences between V2.0 and V1.2 Abstraction has been applied to the underlying model with the inclusion of SPDX elements. With SPDX 2.0, the concept of an SPDX element is introduced (see Appendix III). This includes SPDX documents, SPDX files, and SPDX packages, each of which gets associated with an SPDX identifier which is denoted by \u201cSPDXRef-\u201d. SPDX relationships have been added to allow any SPDX element to have a relationship to other SPDX elements. Documented the origin of an SPDX hierarchy of sub-packages, documenting the origin of an SPDX element, and documenting modifications or corrections (annotations) to an SPDX element. The ability to reference SPDX elements outside the current SPDX document itself (external references). Additional file types are now supported. Additional checksum algorithms are now supported. Review Information section is deprecated. It is recommended to provide document reviews with Annotations (Section 7). A License Expression Syntax has been introduced and documented in Appendix IV.","title":"Diffs from Previous Editions"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#annex-a-differences-from-previous-editions-informative","text":"","title":"Annex A: Differences from previous editions (Informative)"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#a1-differences-between-v30-and-v23","text":"","title":"A.1 Differences between V3.0 and V2.3"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#structural-differences","text":"These are the most significant breaking changes requiring a change in logic to handle a different model or structure for the information.

This is a shortcut linkage to tie the referenced element to its defining SpdxDocument for verification and location information.","title":"Translating from 2.3 to 3.0"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#rationale","text":"A key difference between SPDX 2.3 and SPDX 3.0 is that in SPDX 2.3 elements are always expressed within or referenced in relation to a single enclosing SpdxDocument while in SPDX 3.0 a key design principle is that all elements may be expressed and referenced independent of any other element including SpdxDocument. This independence is required to support a variety of content exchange and analysis use cases. For example, in SPDX 2.3 if you wish to express even a single package you specify it within an SpdxDocument and its identifier namespace is restricted to the namespace of the SpdxDocument. In SPDX 3.0 you could specify a single package within an SpdxDocument element (or any other subclass of ElementCollection such as Bundle, Bom, Sbom, etc.) but you could also simply specify it on its own without any enclosing collection element. In addition, in SPDX 3.0 the identifier of the package may share a namespace with an enclosing collection element such as SpdxDocument if desired but it is equally valid for it to have any namespace desired unconstrained by any other element namespace whether it is expressed within a collection element such as SpdxDocument or not. In this example, in SPDX 2.3 if you referenced the package within the same SpdxDocument that it is defined in you would utilize the local portion of its identifier and presume that the namespace is the same as the SpdxDocument namespace. If you referenced it from an SpdxDocument other than the one it is defined in you would use an ExternalDocumentRef to specify a prefix name for the other SpdxDocument to be used within the current SpdxDocument, the URI namespace/identifier for the other SpdxDocument, and a checksum for the other SpdxDocument. To reference the package you would then use an identifier combining the external document ref prefix and the local portion of the identifier. The ExternalDocumentRef structure in SPDX 2.3 is based on the presumptions that elements are always defined within SpdxDocuments, that external elements can always be referenced via a containing SpdxDocument and that element identifiers have a namespace from their original containing SpdxDocument. None of these three presumptions hold true for SPDX 3.0 so a slightly modified structure is necessary to support the two use cases previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef in SPDX 2.3: 1) the ability to specify identifier namespace prefixes and accompanying namespaces for SPDX elements to support more terse serialized expression of content with integrity across serialization forms, 2) the ability to specify which elements in the current subclass of ElementCollection (e.g., SpdxDocument) are only referenced from that collection and defined elsewhere, along with details regarding their verification and location. The Namespace map structure in SPDX 3.0 fully supports the namespace prefixing use case for SpdxDocuments previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef but also equally covers the same use case capability for all element types and for any number of element identifier namespaces (in SPDX 3.0 all elements within an SpdxDocument are not required to have the same namespace and can actually be any desired mix of namespaces) to support this capability required in SPDX 3.0. The ExternalMap structure in SPDX 3.0 fully supports the external element (including SpdxDocument elements) referencing use case for SpdxDocuments previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef but also equally covers the same use case capability for any elements whether they were originally defined within an SpdxDocument or not to support this capability required in SPDX 3.0. The ExternalMap structure in SPDX 3.0 provides the ability to specify verification and location details for any element, not just SpdxDocuments, if appropriate but also provides simple linkage, using the \u201cdefiningDocument'' property, from element entries in the ExternalMap to SpdxDocument entries in the ExternalMap where the elements were defined within the SpdxDocument and verification of the elements can be achieved via proxy to the SpdxDocument \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d information (this is how the SPDX 2.3 ExternalDocumentRef structure currently works).","title":"Rationale"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#agent","text":"","title":"Agent"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#description-of-change_1","text":"The creator property in SPDX 2.3 has been replaced by createdBy and createdUsing properties with a type Agent and Tool resp.

While it is possible to write all your SPDX documents by hand, we would recommend looking at the various language bindings that are available for crafting more complex documents. Nevertheless, walking through an example of a hand written document can be instructive into how SPDX documents work to better understand concepts that are at play, even when using language bindings. All of the provided fragments listed here are intended to be used to construct a complete a valid SPDX JSON document when concatenated together If you do would like to construct the complete example from this Markdown file, use the following command: cat getting-started.md | awk 'BEGIN{flag=0} /^```json/, $0==\"```\" { if (/^---$/){flag++} else if ($0 !~ /^```.*/ ) print $0 > \"doc-\" flag \".spdx.json\"}' Please note that all descriptions of properties, classes, etc. are non-normative; that is they are intended to help you understand what is going on in simpler language, but are not necessarily complete. Links to the full official documentation are provided where possible. The Preamble All documents need to start somewhere, and SPDX documents are no exception. The root of all SPDX documents will be a JSON object, so start with that: { Next, we need to identify that the document is an SPDX 3 JSON-LD document, which is done with: \"@context\" : \"https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-context.jsonld\" , SPDX documents are designed to be a strict subset of JSON-LD , such that they can be parsed using either a full JSON-LD parser if you need the full power of linked documents or RDF , or a much simpler JSON parser if all you care about is extracting meaningful SPDX data from the document. Because the document is valid JSON-LD, the @context must be provided to tell the JSON-LD parser how to expand the human readable names in the document into full IRIs (don't worry if you don't know what that means, it's not really that important). You can think of this line as telling us \"This is an SPDX document, and this provided URL tells us how to decode it\". The SPDX JSON Schema will force you to put the correct value here when validating a document. Now, we need to specify the list of objects that we want to create in this document. JSON-LD has a special way of specifying this list using the @graph property of the root object like so: \"@graph\" : [ Tell us about yourself Our first SPDX object is going to be a Person that tells us who is writing this document (you!), so lets get started with it: { \"type\" : \"Person\" , This is the basic format for any object in SPDX; all objects have one required property named type that tells us what this object actually is, so here we say this is a Person . Next, we need to name our object: \"spdxId\" : \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" , Most objects can have some sort of \"ID\" property that gives it a name. In the case of Person , that property is called spdxId (inherited from Element ). This property is the URI that should give this object a universally unique name. Although this property looks like a HTTP URL, it is in fact not. Technically speaking, a URL defined a Location , where as a URI defines an Identifier (i.e. the name by which something is known). In all likelihood, a URI is not a resolvable location from whence you can do an HTTP GET to retrieve data, but rather just a way of constructing a namespaced identifier. This identifier can be used within this document to refer to this object (more on that later), or it can be referenced from other documents to refer to this specific object (although in that case there needs to be additional information to describe how to find this document). URI's are considered to be universally unique, so any objects constructed with this URI are considered to be the same object, and any references to this URI is a reference to this specific object we are creating. If you work for a company, own a domain, etc. it is encouraged to use that (or some subdomain of it) in place of spdx.org/spdxdocs . In practice, many spdxId values will have some sort of hash or random UUID-like string incorporated to make them unique. Moving on from this, we have: \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , All SPDX objects derived from Element must specify how they were created by linking to a CreationInfo object. It is important to know the providence of where objects come from; but more on this later. \"name\" : \"Joshua Watt\" , The optional name property is inherited from the Element class, and means \"the common name for the thing\", or in this case, your name. As our last step, we want to indicate another way by which You are known to the world; specifically your E-mail address. To do this we first need to use the (optional) externalIdentifier property which Person inherits from Element : \"externalIdentifier\" : [ This property is an array of ExternalIdentifier objects, so start by adding one to the array: { \"type\" : \"ExternalIdentifier\" , Again notice this uses the type property to identify what the object is. However it should be noted that this is our first object that is not derived from Element , and therefore it does not need a spdxId property. Next, lets add the relevant information about your email address: \"externalIdentifierType\" : \"email\" , \"identifier\" : \"JPEWhacker@gmail.com\" Two properties are used here. First, externalIdentifierType is used to indicate what type of external identifier this is. There are many choices, but in the case we are specifying your email address, so we choose the value email . The second property is the indentifier property which is the actual string identifier (in this case, your email address). We are now done with our Person , so close it all out and prepare for the next object: } ] }, Where did all this stuff come from? Our next object is going to be a CreationInfo object. It is required to provide one for every SPDX document, as all objects derived from Element must link to one in their creationInfo property to indicate where they came from. Note that the CreationInfo describes where a SPDX Element itself came from (that is, who wrote the actual JSON). This is a distinct concept from describing where the thing an Element describes comes from, which is covered later. Lets get started: { \"type\" : \"CreationInfo\" , Hopefully this is making sense. We are saying this object is a CreationInfo . \"@id\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , This object also has an @id similar to the spdxId of our person, but it is subtly different First of all, this one is not a URI like our Person , but instead starts with a _: . This type of identifier is known as a blank node . Blank nodes serve a similar purpose to the URI of the spdxId , however they only have scope within this SPDX document. What this means is that it be impossible to reference this CreationInfo by name outside of this document. Inside the document, you can use this identifier to refer to this object. The string after the _: is arbitrary and you may choose whatever unique (within the document) string that you choose. It should be noted that CreationInfo does not derive from Element class (like our previous example of ExternalIdentifier ), and as such the @id property is technically optional. However, since we will need to refer to this object at other places in the document, we must give it an identifier. This also means that this object does not have a mandatory creationInfo property (which makes sense since it would be a circular reference). Finally, CreationInfo is only allowed to have a blank node identifier. If you look back at the Person we just created, you'll notice that its creationInfo property has the string value that matches the @id of this object; this is how objects are linked together by reference in SPDX. Next, we need to specify which version of the SPDX spec that elements linking to this CreationInfo are conforming to: \"specVersion\" : \"3.0.0\" , Now, we need to use the createdBy property to indicated who (or what) created the elements that are linked to this CreationInfo : \"createdBy\" : [ \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" ], This property is a list of reference to any class that derives from Agent . Since you are the person writing the document, put a single list item that is the spdxId of your Person element here to link them together. Note that even though this is using a full URI instead of a blank node, this is linking in the same way as creationInfo described above. Also, it is worth noting that this does indeed create a circular reference between our Person . creationInfo property and CreationInfo . createdBy property. This is fine in SPDX, as objects are not required to be a Directed Acyclical Graph (DAG). Finally, we need to specify the date that any objects linking to this CreationInfo were created using the created property and close out the object: \"created\" : \"2024-03-06T00:00:00Z\" }, Use today's date and time in ISO 8601 with the format: \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\" . The timezone should always be UTC. Describing the Document SPDX requires that information about the document itself be provided. In order to do this, we must create a SpdxDocument object, so lets do that now: { \"type\" : \"SpdxDocument\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Document1-d078aed9-384d-4a64-87cb-99c79647c8c9\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , SpdxDocument derives from Element , so it has 3 required properties, type , spdxId and creationInfo . We've seen all of these properties before in Person , so hopefully this getting more familiar. Note that we again link back out our previous CreationInfo object. Next, we need to indicate which Profiles our document uses using the profileConformance property. This can be used by consumers of the document to quickly determine if the information they want is in the document (for example, if a user wants to find CVE data, but the security profile is not present, there is no reason to continue looking in this document). \"profileConformance\" : [ \"core\" , \"software\" ], In this case, we are saying this document conforms to the core profile (all SPDX documents should include this), and the software profile, since we will be describing some software later. The final property we need to define is rootElement . This property is a list of Element (or any subclass of Element) references. Add this now and close our our SpdxDocument : \"rootElement\" : [ \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/BOM-e2e955f5-c50e-4a3a-8c69-db152f0f4615\" ] }, The purpose of this property is to indicate the \"interesting\" element(s) in the document. Since a document can contain a large number of elements, it might be difficult for a consumer of the document to know what the focus of the document is. This property clarifies that by suggesting which element(s) a user should look at to start navigating. While it is possible to have more than one root element, it is rare to need more than one. Careful readers of the SpdxDocument documentation will note that we have omitted the element (derived from the ElementCollection parent class). Technically speaking, the property should link to all the elements that are in the document using this property. However because this would be error prone, it is implied that all Element objects present in the @graph (that is, all the objects we are writing) are implicitly added to the element property. A Complete Document! At this point, we have a completed SPDX document (albeit, one that has an unresolved references in SpdxDocument . rootElement ). This is a fully valid document because it has the SPDX 3.0 preamble, and the required SpdxDocument object, which in turn requires a valid CreationInfo , which we've provided. Finally, the CreationInfo requires an Agent to describe who or what created the Elements in the document, which we've provided by writing a Person object which describes you. While this is the minimal example, it may feel long. However, as we continue in the document it should become more apparent how reuse of these 3 objects (particularly the CreationInfo ) helps reduce total document size while still conveying precise information. In addition, there are other options to make a more compact document that are not covered yet, such as referring to a external Agent instead of encoding it in the document. Lets Add Some Software! Now that we have the basic valid document, its time to start adding some interesting data to it. Lets start with a fictitious software package called amazing-widget which we distribute as a tarball for users to download and run. To start with, we need to define a software_Package object the defines how our software is distributed. In this case, the software_Package will be describing a tarball which someone can download, but it can be almost any unit of content that can be used to distribute software (either as binaries or source). See the documentation for more details. Lets define our package: { \"type\" : \"software_Package\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Package-d1db6e61-aebe-4b13-ae73-d0f66018dbe0\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , This should be familiar by now. Note the reuse of our previous CreationInfo . Also note that this is our first element that is outside of the Core profile in SPDX. In this specific case, the class is defined in the Software profile, and as such is prefixed with software_ . Any classes and properties that are defined in a profile other than Core will be prefixed with the lower case profile name + _ to disambiguate them from classes and properties with the same name in other profiles. Again, we can use Element . name to give the common name for our package: \"name\" : \"amazing-widget\" , Importantly, even though this is a class defined in the Software profile, name is defined in core so it does not get prefixed. When writing objects, pay attention to which profile the property is defined in, as that sets the prefix (the documentation should make it clear what the serialized name of a property is if you are unsure TODO: It does not yet ). Next, we will define what version the amazing-widget package is using software_packageVersion , and where the user could download this package from using software_downloadLocation (both are optional): \"software_packageVersion\" : \"1.0\" , \"software_downloadLocation\" : \"http://dl.example.com/amazing-widget_1.0.0.tar\" , These are our first two examples of properties not defined in the Core profile, and as such they get the software_ prefix. Now, we should define when this software was packaged using the (optional) builtTime property, so that downstream users can tell how old it is: \"builtTime\" : \"2024-03-06T00:00:00Z\" , Note that we are back in the Core profile properties here (specifically, builtTime is a property of Artifact in Core ) Next, we want to indicate who actually made the package we are describing. This is done using the (optional) originatedBy array property: \"originatedBy\" : [ \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" ], In this example, you can put a single element that references your Person spdxId here to indicate that you actually made the package. Note that while we are using the same spdxId as we used in the CreationInfo , this is not required. originatedBy is the property that we used to describe who made the actual package being described by the software_Package and not the JSON object itself. Finally, we would like to inform consumers of our SPDX how they can validate the package to ensure its contents have not changed, or to check if a file that they have is the same one being described by this document. This is done using the verifiedUsing property, which is an array of IntegrityMethod objects (or subclasses). \"verifiedUsing\" : [ { \"type\" : \"Hash\" , \"algorithm\" : \"sha256\" , \"hashValue\" : \"f3f60ce8615d1cfb3f6d7d149699ab53170ce0b8f24f841fb616faa50151082d\" } ] }, Specifically, we are using the Hash subclass of integrity method to indicate that the SHA-256 checksum of the package file is f3f60ce8615d1cfb3f6d7d149699ab53170ce0b8f24f841fb616faa50151082d Whats in our Package? Describing that we have a distributed package is a great start, but we are able to go further (although this is not mandatory!). Our next object is going to describe all the files contained in our software_Package by using software_File . Lets get started with our first file, the program executable: { \"type\" : \"software_File\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-8f79956e-4089-4166-9a71-457de77e4846\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , \"name\" : \"/usr/bin/amazing-widget\" , \"verifiedUsing\" : [ { \"type\" : \"Hash\" , \"algorithm\" : \"sha256\" , \"hashValue\" : \"ee4f96ed470ea288be281407dacb380fd355886dbd52c8c684dfec3a90e78f45\" } ], \"builtTime\" : \"2024-03-05T00:00:00Z\" , \"originatedBy\" : [ \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" ], We've seen all this before, so hopefully it all makes sense. While it's great to have a file, it's not easy to tell what purpose this file serves. We might be able to infer that its an executable program from the name , but SPDX provides the ability for us to directly specify this using the (optional) software_primaryPurpose and software_additionalPurpose properties (derived from sofware_Artifact ): \"software_primaryPurpose\" : \"executable\" , \"software_additionalPurpose\" : [ \"application\" ], A software_Artifact can have as many purposes a you want to describe, but there should always be a software_primaryPurpose property defined before any software_additionalPurpose are added. Finally, as one last bit of information, we'll say what the copyright text of the program is using the (optional) software_copyrightText property and close out our file: \"software_copyrightText\" : \"Copyright 2024, Joshua Watt\" }, Lets add one more file for fun. This one will describe a config file for our program: { \"type\" : \"software_File\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-77808a5c-7a1b-43d1-9fa9-410a309ca9f3\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , \"name\" : \"/etc/amazing-widget.cfg\" , \"verifiedUsing\" : [ { \"type\" : \"Hash\" , \"algorithm\" : \"sha256\" , \"hashValue\" : \"89a2e80bc48c4dd10044c441af0fc6fdad5d31b2fa391cb2cf9c51dbf4200ed9\" } ], \"builtTime\" : \"2024-03-05T00:00:00Z\" , \"originatedBy\" : [ \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" ], \"software_primaryPurpose\" : \"configuration\" }, Linking things together with Relationships Now we've described our software_Package , and two software_File s that should be contained in it, but we have one small problem: there is nothing that tells us that our files are actually contained by the package. In order to do this, we must introduce the SPDX Relationship . These are a very powerful concept in SPDX that allows linking Element s and describing how they are related. Relationship s themselves are also derived from SPDX Element s, so we need the required three properties to start a new one: { \"type\" : \"Relationship\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Relationship/contains-6b0b7ce4-a069-406d-9088-9e91f65b79f0\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , Next, we need to say what the relationship between our objects is going to be. We do this using the relationshipType property: \"relationshipType\" : \"contains\" , The full list of what a Relationship can describe is defined by the RelationshipType vocabulary (a fancy work for enumeration). There are a lot of possible options, and each one has a specific meaning and restrictions on what types it can relate, so read the documentation to find the specific one you need and how to use it. In our case, we are using contains which is defined as \"The from Element contains each to Element \". Perfect. Now, we need to describe what Element s are being connected. Relationship s always have a directionality associated with them: you can think of them as an arrow pointing from their from property to their to properties. from is always required and must be a single object, whereas to is a list of zero or more objects. Lets write the JSON to express this: \"from\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Package-d1db6e61-aebe-4b13-ae73-d0f66018dbe0\" , \"to\" : [ \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-8f79956e-4089-4166-9a71-457de77e4846\" , \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-77808a5c-7a1b-43d1-9fa9-410a309ca9f3\" ], This is the minimum required to define a Relationship , but we want to add one more property to convey additional information and close out the object: \"completeness\" : \"complete\" }, The completeness property is very useful as it indicates if we know that this Relationship can be considered to describe all we know about the type of relationship or not. For example, by stating that this relationship is complete , we are saying that our package contains those 2 files, and only those 2 files. We could have also stated that the relationship was incomplete in which case we are stating that we know we didn't list all the files, and other are included. Alternatively, we could have stated that the relationship completeness was noAssertion meaning we don't know if we captured all the files or not. If this property is omitted, it's assumed to be noAssertion . Wrapping it all up in a BOM We've made great progress, and we are almost done. For our final step, we want to wrap up everything we know about the package into a \"Software Bill of Materials\". This is done by creating a software_Sbom object: { \"type\" : \"software_Sbom\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/BOM-e2e955f5-c50e-4a3a-8c69-db152f0f4615\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , Note that this is the object referenced by the rootElement of our SpdxDocument , since it is the primary subject of our entire document. software_Sbom derives from ElementCollection just like SpdxDocument , so it has the same rootElement property. In this case, it is the subject of the SBOM, which is our software_Package : \"rootElement\" : [ \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Package-d1db6e61-aebe-4b13-ae73-d0f66018dbe0\" ], Unlike SpdxDocument however, there is no implicit value for the element property. Instead, we need to list all the elements that are part of this SBOM (think of this as the line items in the SBOM). In our specific case, this is the software_File s that part of our package, but if you had any other elements related to the package (e.g. licenses, security information, etc.) those would also be included: \"element\" : [ \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-8f79956e-4089-4166-9a71-457de77e4846\" , \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-77808a5c-7a1b-43d1-9fa9-410a309ca9f3\" ], Finally, we need to specify what type(s) of BOM this is using the software_sbomType property: \"software_sbomType\" : [ \"build\" ] } This property is effectively indicating at what point in the software lifecycle this SBOM was generated. Since we are describing an executable program, build seems the most likely. Closing it all up Now that we are all done, we have a few things to clean up, namely that we need to close the @graph list and the root object, so lets do that now: ] } Congratulations!

All of the provided fragments listed here are intended to be used to construct a complete a valid SPDX JSON document when concatenated together If you do would like to construct the complete example from this Markdown file, use the following command: cat getting-started.md | awk 'BEGIN{flag=0} /^```json/, $0==\"```\" { if (/^---$/){flag++} else if ($0 !~ /^```.*/ ) print $0 > \"doc-\" flag \".spdx.json\"}' Please note that all descriptions of properties, classes, etc. are non-normative; that is they are intended to help you understand what is going on in simpler language, but are not necessarily complete.

The root of all SPDX documents will be a JSON object, so start with that: { Next, we need to identify that the document is an SPDX 3 JSON-LD document, which is done with: \"@context\" : \"https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-context.jsonld\" , SPDX documents are designed to be a strict subset of JSON-LD , such that they can be parsed using either a full JSON-LD parser if you need the full power of linked documents or RDF , or a much simpler JSON parser if all you care about is extracting meaningful SPDX data from the document. Because the document is valid JSON-LD, the @context must be provided to tell the JSON-LD parser how to expand the human readable names in the document into full IRIs (don't worry if you don't know what that means, it's not really that important). You can think of this line as telling us \"This is an SPDX document, and this provided URL tells us how to decode it\". The SPDX JSON Schema will force you to put the correct value here when validating a document. Now, we need to specify the list of objects that we want to create in this document. JSON-LD has a special way of specifying this list using the @graph property of the root object like so: \"@graph\" : [","title":"The Preamble"},{"location":"annexes/getting-started/#tell-us-about-yourself","text":"Our first SPDX object is going to be a Person that tells us who is writing this document (you!), so lets get started with it: { \"type\" : \"Person\" , This is the basic format for any object in SPDX; all objects have one required property named type that tells us what this object actually is, so here we say this is a Person . Next, we need to name our object: \"spdxId\" : \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" , Most objects can have some sort of \"ID\" property that gives it a name. In the case of Person , that property is called spdxId (inherited from Element ). This property is the URI that should give this object a universally unique name. Although this property looks like a HTTP URL, it is in fact not. Technically speaking, a URL defined a Location , where as a URI defines an Identifier (i.e. the name by which something is known). In all likelihood, a URI is not a resolvable location from whence you can do an HTTP GET to retrieve data, but rather just a way of constructing a namespaced identifier. This identifier can be used within this document to refer to this object (more on that later), or it can be referenced from other documents to refer to this specific object (although in that case there needs to be additional information to describe how to find this document). URI's are considered to be universally unique, so any objects constructed with this URI are considered to be the same object, and any references to this URI is a reference to this specific object we are creating. If you work for a company, own a domain, etc. it is encouraged to use that (or some subdomain of it) in place of spdx.org/spdxdocs . In practice, many spdxId values will have some sort of hash or random UUID-like string incorporated to make them unique. Moving on from this, we have: \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , All SPDX objects derived from Element must specify how they were created by linking to a CreationInfo object. It is important to know the providence of where objects come from; but more on this later. \"name\" : \"Joshua Watt\" , The optional name property is inherited from the Element class, and means \"the common name for the thing\", or in this case, your name. As our last step, we want to indicate another way by which You are known to the world; specifically your E-mail address. To do this we first need to use the (optional) externalIdentifier property which Person inherits from Element : \"externalIdentifier\" : [ This property is an array of ExternalIdentifier objects, so start by adding one to the array: { \"type\" : \"ExternalIdentifier\" , Again notice this uses the type property to identify what the object is. However it should be noted that this is our first object that is not derived from Element , and therefore it does not need a spdxId property. Next, lets add the relevant information about your email address: \"externalIdentifierType\" : \"email\" , \"identifier\" : \"JPEWhacker@gmail.com\" Two properties are used here. First, externalIdentifierType is used to indicate what type of external identifier this is. There are many choices, but in the case we are specifying your email address, so we choose the value email . The second property is the indentifier property which is the actual string identifier (in this case, your email address). We are now done with our Person , so close it all out and prepare for the next object: } ] },","title":"Tell us about yourself"},{"location":"annexes/getting-started/#where-did-all-this-stuff-come-from","text":"Our next object is going to be a CreationInfo object. It is required to provide one for every SPDX document, as all objects derived from Element must link to one in their creationInfo property to indicate where they came from. Note that the CreationInfo describes where a SPDX Element itself came from (that is, who wrote the actual JSON). This is a distinct concept from describing where the thing an Element describes comes from, which is covered later. Lets get started: { \"type\" : \"CreationInfo\" , Hopefully this is making sense. We are saying this object is a CreationInfo . \"@id\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , This object also has an @id similar to the spdxId of our person, but it is subtly different First of all, this one is not a URI like our Person , but instead starts with a _: . This type of identifier is known as a blank node . Blank nodes serve a similar purpose to the URI of the spdxId , however they only have scope within this SPDX document. What this means is that it be impossible to reference this CreationInfo by name outside of this document. Inside the document, you can use this identifier to refer to this object. The string after the _: is arbitrary and you may choose whatever unique (within the document) string that you choose. It should be noted that CreationInfo does not derive from Element class (like our previous example of ExternalIdentifier ), and as such the @id property is technically optional. However, since we will need to refer to this object at other places in the document, we must give it an identifier. This also means that this object does not have a mandatory creationInfo property (which makes sense since it would be a circular reference). Finally, CreationInfo is only allowed to have a blank node identifier. If you look back at the Person we just created, you'll notice that its creationInfo property has the string value that matches the @id of this object; this is how objects are linked together by reference in SPDX. Next, we need to specify which version of the SPDX spec that elements linking to this CreationInfo are conforming to: \"specVersion\" : \"3.0.0\" , Now, we need to use the createdBy property to indicated who (or what) created the elements that are linked to this CreationInfo : \"createdBy\" : [ \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" ], This property is a list of reference to any class that derives from Agent . Since you are the person writing the document, put a single list item that is the spdxId of your Person element here to link them together. Note that even though this is using a full URI instead of a blank node, this is linking in the same way as creationInfo described above. Also, it is worth noting that this does indeed create a circular reference between our Person . creationInfo property and CreationInfo . createdBy property. This is fine in SPDX, as objects are not required to be a Directed Acyclical Graph (DAG). Finally, we need to specify the date that any objects linking to this CreationInfo were created using the created property and close out the object: \"created\" : \"2024-03-06T00:00:00Z\" }, Use today's date and time in ISO 8601 with the format: \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\" . The timezone should always be UTC.","title":"Where did all this stuff come from?"},{"location":"annexes/getting-started/#describing-the-document","text":"SPDX requires that information about the document itself be provided. In order to do this, we must create a SpdxDocument object, so lets do that now: { \"type\" : \"SpdxDocument\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Document1-d078aed9-384d-4a64-87cb-99c79647c8c9\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , SpdxDocument derives from Element , so it has 3 required properties, type , spdxId and creationInfo . We've seen all of these properties before in Person , so hopefully this getting more familiar. Note that we again link back out our previous CreationInfo object. Next, we need to indicate which Profiles our document uses using the profileConformance property. This can be used by consumers of the document to quickly determine if the information they want is in the document (for example, if a user wants to find CVE data, but the security profile is not present, there is no reason to continue looking in this document). \"profileConformance\" : [ \"core\" , \"software\" ], In this case, we are saying this document conforms to the core profile (all SPDX documents should include this), and the software profile, since we will be describing some software later. The final property we need to define is rootElement . This property is a list of Element (or any subclass of Element) references. Add this now and close our our SpdxDocument : \"rootElement\" : [ \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/BOM-e2e955f5-c50e-4a3a-8c69-db152f0f4615\" ] }, The purpose of this property is to indicate the \"interesting\" element(s) in the document. Since a document can contain a large number of elements, it might be difficult for a consumer of the document to know what the focus of the document is. This property clarifies that by suggesting which element(s) a user should look at to start navigating. While it is possible to have more than one root element, it is rare to need more than one. Careful readers of the SpdxDocument documentation will note that we have omitted the element (derived from the ElementCollection parent class). Technically speaking, the property should link to all the elements that are in the document using this property. However because this would be error prone, it is implied that all Element objects present in the @graph (that is, all the objects we are writing) are implicitly added to the element property.","title":"Describing the Document"},{"location":"annexes/getting-started/#a-complete-document","text":"At this point, we have a completed SPDX document (albeit, one that has an unresolved references in SpdxDocument . rootElement ). This is a fully valid document because it has the SPDX 3.0 preamble, and the required SpdxDocument object, which in turn requires a valid CreationInfo , which we've provided. Finally, the CreationInfo requires an Agent to describe who or what created the Elements in the document, which we've provided by writing a Person object which describes you. While this is the minimal example, it may feel long. However, as we continue in the document it should become more apparent how reuse of these 3 objects (particularly the CreationInfo ) helps reduce total document size while still conveying precise information. In addition, there are other options to make a more compact document that are not covered yet, such as referring to a external Agent instead of encoding it in the document.","title":"A Complete Document!"},{"location":"annexes/getting-started/#lets-add-some-software","text":"Now that we have the basic valid document, its time to start adding some interesting data to it. Lets start with a fictitious software package called amazing-widget which we distribute as a tarball for users to download and run. To start with, we need to define a software_Package object the defines how our software is distributed. In this case, the software_Package will be describing a tarball which someone can download, but it can be almost any unit of content that can be used to distribute software (either as binaries or source). See the documentation for more details. Lets define our package: { \"type\" : \"software_Package\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Package-d1db6e61-aebe-4b13-ae73-d0f66018dbe0\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , This should be familiar by now. Note the reuse of our previous CreationInfo . Also note that this is our first element that is outside of the Core profile in SPDX. In this specific case, the class is defined in the Software profile, and as such is prefixed with software_ . Any classes and properties that are defined in a profile other than Core will be prefixed with the lower case profile name + _ to disambiguate them from classes and properties with the same name in other profiles. Again, we can use Element . name to give the common name for our package: \"name\" : \"amazing-widget\" , Importantly, even though this is a class defined in the Software profile, name is defined in core so it does not get prefixed. When writing objects, pay attention to which profile the property is defined in, as that sets the prefix (the documentation should make it clear what the serialized name of a property is if you are unsure TODO: It does not yet ). Next, we will define what version the amazing-widget package is using software_packageVersion , and where the user could download this package from using software_downloadLocation (both are optional): \"software_packageVersion\" : \"1.0\" , \"software_downloadLocation\" : \"http://dl.example.com/amazing-widget_1.0.0.tar\" , These are our first two examples of properties not defined in the Core profile, and as such they get the software_ prefix. Now, we should define when this software was packaged using the (optional) builtTime property, so that downstream users can tell how old it is: \"builtTime\" : \"2024-03-06T00:00:00Z\" , Note that we are back in the Core profile properties here (specifically, builtTime is a property of Artifact in Core ) Next, we want to indicate who actually made the package we are describing. This is done using the (optional) originatedBy array property: \"originatedBy\" : [ \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" ], In this example, you can put a single element that references your Person spdxId here to indicate that you actually made the package. Note that while we are using the same spdxId as we used in the CreationInfo , this is not required. originatedBy is the property that we used to describe who made the actual package being described by the software_Package and not the JSON object itself. Finally, we would like to inform consumers of our SPDX how they can validate the package to ensure its contents have not changed, or to check if a file that they have is the same one being described by this document. This is done using the verifiedUsing property, which is an array of IntegrityMethod objects (or subclasses). \"verifiedUsing\" : [ { \"type\" : \"Hash\" , \"algorithm\" : \"sha256\" , \"hashValue\" : \"f3f60ce8615d1cfb3f6d7d149699ab53170ce0b8f24f841fb616faa50151082d\" } ] }, Specifically, we are using the Hash subclass of integrity method to indicate that the SHA-256 checksum of the package file is f3f60ce8615d1cfb3f6d7d149699ab53170ce0b8f24f841fb616faa50151082d","title":"Lets Add Some Software!"},{"location":"annexes/getting-started/#whats-in-our-package","text":"Describing that we have a distributed package is a great start, but we are able to go further (although this is not mandatory!). Our next object is going to describe all the files contained in our software_Package by using software_File . Lets get started with our first file, the program executable: { \"type\" : \"software_File\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-8f79956e-4089-4166-9a71-457de77e4846\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , \"name\" : \"/usr/bin/amazing-widget\" , \"verifiedUsing\" : [ { \"type\" : \"Hash\" , \"algorithm\" : \"sha256\" , \"hashValue\" : \"ee4f96ed470ea288be281407dacb380fd355886dbd52c8c684dfec3a90e78f45\" } ], \"builtTime\" : \"2024-03-05T00:00:00Z\" , \"originatedBy\" : [ \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" ], We've seen all this before, so hopefully it all makes sense. While it's great to have a file, it's not easy to tell what purpose this file serves. We might be able to infer that its an executable program from the name , but SPDX provides the ability for us to directly specify this using the (optional) software_primaryPurpose and software_additionalPurpose properties (derived from sofware_Artifact ): \"software_primaryPurpose\" : \"executable\" , \"software_additionalPurpose\" : [ \"application\" ], A software_Artifact can have as many purposes a you want to describe, but there should always be a software_primaryPurpose property defined before any software_additionalPurpose are added. Finally, as one last bit of information, we'll say what the copyright text of the program is using the (optional) software_copyrightText property and close out our file: \"software_copyrightText\" : \"Copyright 2024, Joshua Watt\" }, Lets add one more file for fun. This one will describe a config file for our program: { \"type\" : \"software_File\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-77808a5c-7a1b-43d1-9fa9-410a309ca9f3\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , \"name\" : \"/etc/amazing-widget.cfg\" , \"verifiedUsing\" : [ { \"type\" : \"Hash\" , \"algorithm\" : \"sha256\" , \"hashValue\" : \"89a2e80bc48c4dd10044c441af0fc6fdad5d31b2fa391cb2cf9c51dbf4200ed9\" } ], \"builtTime\" : \"2024-03-05T00:00:00Z\" , \"originatedBy\" : [ \"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Person/JoshuaWatt-141ec767-40f2-4aad-9658-ac2703f3a7d9\" ], \"software_primaryPurpose\" : \"configuration\" },","title":"Whats in our Package?"},{"location":"annexes/getting-started/#linking-things-together-with-relationships","text":"Now we've described our software_Package , and two software_File s that should be contained in it, but we have one small problem: there is nothing that tells us that our files are actually contained by the package. In order to do this, we must introduce the SPDX Relationship . These are a very powerful concept in SPDX that allows linking Element s and describing how they are related. Relationship s themselves are also derived from SPDX Element s, so we need the required three properties to start a new one: { \"type\" : \"Relationship\" , \"spdxId\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Relationship/contains-6b0b7ce4-a069-406d-9088-9e91f65b79f0\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationinfo\" , Next, we need to say what the relationship between our objects is going to be. We do this using the relationshipType property: \"relationshipType\" : \"contains\" , The full list of what a Relationship can describe is defined by the RelationshipType vocabulary (a fancy work for enumeration). There are a lot of possible options, and each one has a specific meaning and restrictions on what types it can relate, so read the documentation to find the specific one you need and how to use it. In our case, we are using contains which is defined as \"The from Element contains each to Element \". Perfect. Now, we need to describe what Element s are being connected. Relationship s always have a directionality associated with them: you can think of them as an arrow pointing from their from property to their to properties. from is always required and must be a single object, whereas to is a list of zero or more objects. Lets write the JSON to express this: \"from\" : \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/Package-d1db6e61-aebe-4b13-ae73-d0f66018dbe0\" , \"to\" : [ \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-8f79956e-4089-4166-9a71-457de77e4846\" , \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-77808a5c-7a1b-43d1-9fa9-410a309ca9f3\" ], This is the minimum required to define a Relationship , but we want to add one more property to convey additional information and close out the object: \"completeness\" : \"complete\" }, The completeness property is very useful as it indicates if we know that this Relationship can be considered to describe all we know about the type of relationship or not. For example, by stating that this relationship is complete , we are saying that our package contains those 2 files, and only those 2 files. We could have also stated that the relationship was incomplete in which case we are stating that we know we didn't list all the files, and other are included. Alternatively, we could have stated that the relationship completeness was noAssertion meaning we don't know if we captured all the files or not. If this property is omitted, it's assumed to be noAssertion .","title":"Linking things together with Relationships"},{"location":"annexes/getting-started/#wrapping-it-all-up-in-a-bom","text":"We've made great progress, and we are almost done. For our final step, we want to wrap up everything we know about the package into a \"Software Bill of Materials\".

Instead, we need to list all the elements that are part of this SBOM (think of this as the line items in the SBOM). In our specific case, this is the software_File s that part of our package, but if you had any other elements related to the package (e.g. licenses, security information, etc.) those would also be included: \"element\" : [ \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-8f79956e-4089-4166-9a71-457de77e4846\" , \"https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/File-77808a5c-7a1b-43d1-9fa9-410a309ca9f3\" ], Finally, we need to specify what type(s) of BOM this is using the software_sbomType property: \"software_sbomType\" : [ \"build\" ] } This property is effectively indicating at what point in the software lifecycle this SBOM was generated.

Use the External Reference vulnerabilityDisclosureReport type to report on vulnerabilities related to the components contained in a software product\u2019s SBOM. This enables a software producer to articulate to software consumers the status of vulnerabilities contained in the software product, by means of reporting vulnerability information at either the SBOM document or component level. Providing a link to such data at the time the SBOM is published provides a pointer for where to find this relevant vulnerability information without promulgating vulnerability information inside the SBOM. This is advantageous because the vulnerability information has a short shelf-life (it will change frequently) while the SBOM component data isn\u2019t likely to change if the software has not changed. { \"type\" : \"software_Package\" , \"spdxId\" : \"urn:spdx.dev:sag-pm\" , \"creationInfo\" : \"_:creationInfo\" , \"name\" : \"SAG-PM (TM)\" , \"software_packageVersion\" : \"1.1.8\" , \"externalRef\" : [ { \"type\" : \"ExternalRef\" , \"externalRefType\" : \"vulnerabilityDisclosureReport\" , \"locator\" : [ \"https://github.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products/blob/master/SBOM_and_VDRbaseline/sag-pm-118_VDR.json\" ] } ] },","title":"Including Security Information in SPDX"},{"location":"annexes/including-security-information-in-SPDX/#annex-g-including-security-information-in-a-spdx-document","text":"The flexibility of SPDX 3.0 allows users to either link SBOMs to external security vulnerability data or to embed security vulnerability information in the SPDX 3.0 data format.

There is no intent here to make a judgment or interpretation, but merely to ensure that when one SPDX user identifies a license as \"BSD-3-Clause,\" for example, it is indeed the same license as what someone else identifies as \"BSD-3-Clause\" and the same license as what is listed on the SPDX License List. As noted here, some of the matching guidelines are implemented in the XML files of the SPDX License List repository. C.2 How these guidelines are applied C.2.1 Purpose To ensure consistent results by different SPDX document creators when matching license information that will be included in the License Information in File field. SPDX document creators or tools may match on the license or exception text itself, the official license header, or the SPDX License List short identifier. C.2.2 Guideline: official license headers The matching guidelines apply to license and exception text, as well as official license headers. Official license headers are defined by the SPDX License List as specific text specified within the license itself to be put in the header of files. (see explanation of SPDX License List fields for more info). The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <standardLicenseHeader> C.3 Substantive text C.3.1 Purpose To ensure that when matching licenses and exceptions to the SPDX License List, there is an appropriate balance between matching against the substantive text and disregarding parts of the text that do not alter the substantive text or legal meaning. Further guidelines of what can be disregarded or considered replaceable for purposes of matching are listed below here and in the subsequent specific guidelines. A conservative approach is taken in regard to rules relating to disregarded or replaceable text. C.3.2 Guideline: verbatim text License and exception text should be the same verbatim text (except for the guidelines stated here). The text should be in the same order, e.g., differently ordered paragraphs would not be considered a match. C.3.3 Guideline: no additional text Matched text should only include that found in the vetted license or exception text. Where a license or exception found includes additional text or clauses, this should not be considered a match. C.3.4 Guideline: replaceable text Some licenses include text that refers to the specific copyright holder or author, yet the rest of the license is exactly the same. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of a specific name in one part of the license resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match to the legally substantive terms (e.g., the third clause and disclaimer in the BSD licenses, or the third, fourth, and fifth clauses of Apache-1.1). In these cases, there should be a positive license match. The text indicated as such can be replaced with similar values (e.g., a different name or generic term; different date) and still be considered a positive match. This rule also applies to text-matching in official license headers (see Guideline: official license headers). The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline. <alt> with 2 attributes: match - a POSIX extended regular expression (ERE) to match the replaceable text name - an identifier for the variable text unique to the license XML document The original text is enclosed within the beginning and ending alt tags. For example: <alt match=\"(?i:copyright.{0,200}).\" name=\"copyright1\">Copyright Linux Foundation</alt> The original replaceable text appears on the SPDX License List webpage in red text. C.3.5 Guideline: omittable text Some licenses have text that can simply be ignored. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of certain text that is superfluous or irrelevant in regards to the substantive license text resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match (e.g., directions on how to apply the license or other similar exhibits). In these cases, there should be a positive license match. The license should be considered a match if the text indicated is present and matches OR the text indicated is missing altogether. The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <optional> For example: <optional>Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/</optional> Omittable text appears on the SPDX License List webpage in blue text. C.4 Whitespace C.4.1 Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to different spacing of words, line breaks, or paragraphs. C.4.2 Guideline All whitespace should be treated as a single blank space. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. C.5 Capitalization C.5.1 Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to lowercase or uppercase letters in otherwise the same words. C.5.2 Guideline All uppercase and lowercase letters should be treated as lowercase letters. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. C.6 Punctuation C.6.1 Purpose Because punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence, punctuation needs to be included in the matching process. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline, unless to indicate an exception to the guideline. C.6.2 Guideline: punctuation Punctuation should be matched, unless otherwise stated in these guidelines or unless specific markup is added. C.6.3 Guideline: hyphens, dashes Any hyphen, dash, en dash, em dash, or other variation should be considered equivalent. C.6.4 Guideline: Quotes Any variation of quotations (single, double, curly, etc.) should be considered equivalent. C.7 Code Comment Indicators or Separators C.7.1 Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the existence or absence of code comment indicators placed within the license text, e.g., at the start of each line of text, or repetitive characters to establish a separation of text, e.g., ---, ===, ___, or ***. C.7.2 Guideline Any kind of code comment indicator or prefix which occurs at the beginning of each line in a matchable section should be ignored for matching purposes. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. C.7.3 Guideline A non-letter character repeated 3 or more times to establish a visual separation should be ignored for matching purposes. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. C.8 Bullets and numbering C.8.1 Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the otherwise same license using bullets instead of numbers, number instead of letter, or no bullets instead of bullet, etc., for a list of clauses. C.8.2 Guideline Where a line starts with a bullet, number, letter, or some form of a list item (determined where list item is followed by a space, then the text of the sentence), ignore the list item for matching purposes. The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <bullet> For example: <bullet>1.0</bullet> C.9 Varietal word spelling C.9.1 Purpose English uses different spelling for some words. By identifying the spelling variations for words found or likely to be found in licenses, we avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the same word being spelled differently. This list is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all spelling variations, but meant to capture the words most likely to be found in open source software licenses. C.9.2 Guideline The words in each line of the text file available at https://spdx.org/licenses/equivalentwords.txt are considered equivalent and interchangeable. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. C.10 Copyright symbol C.10.1 Purpose By having a rule regarding the use of \"\u00a9\", \"(c)\", or \"copyright\", we avoid the possibility of a mismatch based on these variations. C.10.2 Guideline \"\u00a9\", \"(c)\", or \"Copyright\" should be considered equivalent and interchangeable. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. The copyright symbol is part of the copyright notice, see implementation of that guideline below. C.11 Copyright notice C.11.1 Purpose To avoid a license mismatch merely because the copyright notice (usually found above the actual license or exception text) is different. The copyright notice is important information to be recorded elsewhere in the SPDX document, but for the purposes of matching a license to the SPDX License List, it should be ignored because it is not part of the substantive license text. C.11.2 Guideline Ignore copyright notices. A copyright notice consists of the following elements, for example: \"2012 Copyright, John Doe. All rights reserved.\" or \"(c) 2012 John Doe.\" The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <copyrightText> For example: <copyrightText>Copyright 2022 Linux Foundation</copyrightText> C.12 License name or title C.12.1 Purpose To avoid a license mismatch merely because the name or title of the license is different than how the license is usually referred to or different than the SPDX full name. This also avoids a mismatch if the title or name of the license is simply not included. C.12.2 Guideline Ignore the license name or title for matching purposes, so long as what ignored is the title only and there is no additional substantive text added here. The following XML tag is used to implement this guideline: <titleText> For example: <titleText>Attribution Assurance License</titleText> C.13 Extraneous text at the end of a license C.13.1 Purpose To avoid a license mismatch merely because extraneous text that appears at the end of the terms of a license is different or missing. This also avoids a mismatch if the extraneous text merely serves as a license notice example and includes a specific copyright holder's name. C.13.2 Guideline Ignore any text that occurs after the obvious end of the license and does not include substantive text of the license, for example: text that occurs after a statement such as, \"END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS,\" or an exhibit or appendix that includes an example or instructions on to how to apply the license to your code. Do not apply this guideline or ignore text that is comprised of additional license terms (e.g., permitted additional terms under GPL-3.0, section 7). To implement this guideline, use the <optional> XML element tag as described in section C.3.5. C.14 HTTP Protocol C.14.1 Purpose To avoid a license mismatch due to a difference in a hyperlink protocol (e.g. http vs. https). C.14.2 Guideline HTTP:// and HTTPS:// should be considered equivalent. XML files do not require specific markup to implement this guideline. C.15 SPDX License list C.15.1 Template access The license XML can be accessed in the license-list-data repository under the license-list-XML directory. Although the license list XML files can also be found in the license-list-XML repo, users are encouraged to use the published versions in the license-list-data repository. The license-list-data repository is tagged by release. Only tagged released versions of the license list are considered stable.

A package URL or purl is an attempt to standardize existing approaches to reliably identify the location of software packages. A purl is a URL string used to identify the location of a software package in a mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages, package managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases. Such a package URL is useful to reliably reference the same software package using a simple and expressive syntax and conventions based on familiar URLs. E.2 Syntax definition purl stands for package URL . A purl is a URL composed of seven components: scheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath Components are separated by a specific character for unambiguous parsing. The definition for each components is: scheme : this is the URL scheme with the constant value of \" pkg \". One of the primary reason for this single scheme is to facilitate the future official registration of the \" pkg \" scheme for package URLs. Required. type : the package type or package protocol such as maven, npm, nuget, gem, pypi, etc. Required. namespace : some name prefix such as a Maven groupid, a Docker image owner, a GitHub user or organization. Optional and type-specific. name : the name of the package. Required. version : the version of the package. Optional. qualifiers : extra qualifying data for a package such as an OS, architecture, a distribution, etc. Optional and type-specific. subpath : extra subpath within a package, relative to the package root. Optional. Components are designed such that they form a hierarchy from the most significant on the left to the least significant components on the right. A purl is a valid URL and URI that conforms to the URL definitions and specifications in RFC 3986 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986 . A purl must not contain a URL Authority i.e. there is no support for username, password, host and port components. A namespace segment may sometimes look like a host but its interpretation is specific to a type. The purl components are mapped to the following URL components: purl scheme: this is a URL scheme with a constant value: pkg purl type, namespace, name and version components: these are collectively mapped to a URL path purl qualifiers: this maps to a URL query purl subpath: this is a URL fragment E.3 Character encoding For clarity and simplicity a purl is always an ASCII string. To ensure that there is no ambiguity when parsing a purl , separator characters and non-ASCII characters must be encoded in UTF-8, and then percent-encoded as defined in RFC 3986 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986 . Use these rules for percent-encoding and decoding purl components: the type must NOT be encoded and must NOT contain separators the # , ? , @ and : characters must NOT be encoded when used as separators. They may need to be encoded elsewhere the : scheme and type separator does not need to and must NOT be encoded. It is unambiguous unencoded everywhere the / used as type/namespace/name and subpath segments separator does not need to and must NOT be percent-encoded. It is unambiguous unencoded everywhere the @ version separator must be encoded as %40 elsewhere the ? qualifiers separator must be encoded as %3F elsewhere the = qualifiers key/value separator must NOT be encoded the # subpath separator must be encoded as %23 elsewhere All non-ASCII characters must be encoded as UTF-8 and then percent-encoded It is OK to percent-encode any purl components, except for the type. Producers and consumers of purl data must always percent-decode and percent-encode components and component segments as explained in the \"How to produce and consume purl data\" section. E.4 Rules for each component A purl string is an ASCII URL string composed of seven components. Some components are allowed to use other characters beyond ASCII: these components must then be UTF-8-encoded strings and percent-encoded as defined in the \"Character encoding\" section. The rules for each component are: E.4.1 Rules for scheme The scheme is a constant with the value \" pkg \" Since a purl never contains a URL Authority, its scheme must not be suffixed with double slash as in pkg:// and should use instead pkg: . purl parsers must accept URLs such as 'pkg://' and must ignore the '//'. purl builders must not create invalid URLs with such double slash '//'. The scheme is followed by a ':' separator. For example, the two purls pkg:gem/ruby-advisory-db-check@0.12.4 and pkg://gem/ruby-advisory-db-check@0.12.4 are strictly equivalent. The first is in canonical form while the second is an acceptable purl but is an invalid URI/URL per RFC3986. E.4.2 Rules for type The package type is composed only of ASCII letters and numbers, . , + and - (period, plus, and dash). The type cannot start with a number. The type cannot contain spaces. The type must not be percent-encoded. The type is case insensitive, with the canonical form being lowercase. E.4.3 Rules for namespace The optional namespace contains zero or more segments, separated by slash / . Leading and trailing slashes / are not significant and should be stripped in the canonical form. They are not part of the namespace. Each namespace segment must be a percent-encoded string. When percent-decoded, a segment must not contain a slash / and must not be empty. A URL host or Authority must NOT be used as a namespace. Use instead a repository_url qualifier. Note however that for some types, the namespace may look like a host. E.4.4 Rules for name The name is prefixed by a slash / separator when the namespace is not empty. This slash / is not part of the name. A name must be a percent-encoded string. E.4.5 Rules for version The version is prefixed by a at-sign @ separator when not empty. This at-sign @ is not part of the version. A version must be a percent-encoded string. A version is a plain and opaque string. Some package types use versioning conventions such as semver for NPMs or nevra conventions for RPMS. A type may define a procedure to compare and sort versions, but there is no reliable and uniform way to do such comparison consistently. E.4.6 Rules for qualifiers The qualifiers string is prefixed by a ? separator when not empty. This ? is not part of the qualifiers. This is a string composed of zero or more key=value pairs each separated by an ampersand & . A key and value are separated by an equal = character. These & are not part of the key=value pairs. Each key must be unique within the keys of the qualifiers string. A value cannot be an empty string; a key=value pair with an empty value is the same as no key/value at all for this key. Each key must be composed only of ASCII letters and numbers, . , - and \\_ (period, dash and underscore). A key cannot start with a number. A key must NOT be percent-encoded. A key is case insensitive, with the canonical form being lowercase. A key cannot contain spaces. A value must be a percent-encoded string. The = separator is neither part of the key nor of the value. E.4.7 Rules for subpath The subpath string is prefixed by a # separator when not empty. This # is not part of the subpath. The subpath contains zero or more segments, separated by slash / . Leading and trailing slashes / are not significant and should be stripped in the canonical form. Each subpath segment must be a percent-encoded string. When percent-decoded, a segment must not contain a / , must not be any of .. or . , and must not be empty. The subpath must be interpreted as relative to the root of the package. E.5 Known types There are several known purl package type definitions. The current list of known types is: alpm , apk , bitbucket , bitnami , cargo , cocoapods , composer , conan , conda , cpan , cran , deb , docker , gem , generic , github , golang , hackage , hex , huggingface , luarocks , maven , mlflow , npm , nuget , oci , pub , pypi , qpkg , rpm , swid , and swift . The list, with definitions for each type, is maintained in the file named PURL-TYPES.rst in the online repository https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec. E.6 Known qualifiers key/value pairs Qualifiers should be limited to the bare minimum for proper package identification, to ensure that a purl stays compact and readable in most cases. Separate external attributes stored outside of a purl are the preferred mechanism to convey extra long and optional information. API, database or web form. The following keys are valid for use in all package types: repository_url is an extra URL for an alternative, non-default package repository or registry. The default repository or registry of each type is documented in the \"Known types\" section. download_url is an extra URL for a direct package web download URL. vcs_url is an extra URL for a package version control system URL. file_name is an extra file name of a package archive. checksum is a qualifier for one or more checksums stored as a comma-separated list. Each item in the list is in form of algorithm:hex_value (all lowercase), such as sha1:ad9503c3e994a4f611a4892f2e67ac82df727086 . E.7 How to produce and consume purl data The following provides rules to be followed when building or deconstructing purl instances. E.7.1 How to build purl string from its components Building a purl ASCII string works from left to right, from type to subpath. To build a purl string from its components: Start a purl string with the \" pkg: \" scheme as a lowercase ASCII string Append the type string to the purl as a lowercase ASCII string Append / to the purl If the namespace is not empty: Strip the namespace from leading and trailing / Split on / as segments Apply type-specific normalization to each segment, if needed Encode each segment in UTF-8-encoding Percent-encode each segment Join the segments with / Append this to the purl Append / to the purl Strip the name from leading and trailing / Apply type-specific normalization to the name, if needed Encode the name in UTF-8-encoding Percent-encode the name Append the percent-encoded name to the purl If the version is not empty: Append @ to the purl Encode the version in UTF-8-encoding Percent-encode the version Append the percent-encoded version to the purl If the qualifiers are not empty and not composed only of key/value pairs where the value is empty: Append ? to the purl Discard any pair where the value is empty Encode each value in UTF-8-encoding If the key is checksum and there are more than one checksums, join the list with , to create the qualifier value Create each qualifier string by joining the lowercased key, the equal = sign, and the percent-encoded value Sort this list of qualifier strings lexicographically Join this list of sorted qualifier strings with & Append this string to the purl If the subpath is not empty and not composed only of empty, . , and .. segments: Append # to the purl Strip the subpath from leading and trailing / Split the subpath on / as a list of segments Discard empty, . , and .. segments Encode each segment in UTF-8-encoding Percent-encode each segment Join the segments with / Append this string to the purl E.7.2 How to parse a purl string to its components Parsing a purl ASCII string into its components works by splitting the string on different characters. To parse a purl string in its components: Split the purl string once from right on # , if present; the left side is the remainder. If the right side is not empty, it contains subpath information: Strip it from leading and trailing / . Split this on / in a list of segments. Discard empty, . , and .. segments. Percent-decode each segment. UTF-8-decode each of these. Join segments with / . This is the subpath. Split the remainder once from right on ? , if present; the left side is the remainder. If the right side is not empty, it contains qualifiers information: Split it on & in a list of key=value pairs. Split each pair once from left on = in key and value parts. The key is the lowercase left side. Percent-decode the right side. UTF-8-decode this to get the value. Discard any key/value pairs where the value is empty. If the key is checksum , split the value on , to create a list of checksums. This list of keys/values is the qualifiers. Split the remainder once from left on : ; the right side is the remainder. The left side lowercased is the scheme. It should be exactly \" pkg: \". Strip the remainder from leading and trailing / . Split this once from left on / ; the right side is the remainder. The left side lowercased is the type. Split the remainder once from right on @ , if present; the left side is the remainder. If the right side is not empty, it contains version information: Percent-decode the string. UTF-8-decode this. This is the version. Split the remainder once from right on / , if present; the left side is the remainder. The right side contains name information. Percent-decode the name string. UTF-8-decode this. Apply type-specific normalization, if needed. This is the name. If the remainder is not empty, it contains namespace information: Split the remainder on / to a list of segments. Discard any empty segment. Percent-decode each segment. UTF-8-decode each of these. Apply type-specific normalization to each segment, if needed. Join segments with / . This is the namespace.

Short identifiers from the SPDX License List can be used to indicate license info at the file level. The advantages of doing this are numerous but include: It is precise. It is concise.

If using SPDX short identifiers in individual files, it is recommended to reproduce the full license in the projects LICENSE file and indicate that SPDX short identifiers are being used to refer to it. For links to projects illustrating these scenarios, see https://spdx.dev/ids-where . E.2 Format for SPDX-License-Identifier The SPDX-License-Identifier tag declares the license the file is under and should be placed at or near the top of the file in a comment. The SPDX License Identifier syntax may consist of a single license (represented by a short identifier from the SPDX license list ) or a compound set of licenses (represented by joining together multiple licenses using the license expression syntax). The tag should appear on its own line in the source file, generally as part of a comment. SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression> E.3 Representing single license A single license is represented by using the short identifier from SPDX license list , optionally with a unary \"+\" operator following it to indicate \"or later\" versions may be applicable. Examples: SPDX-License-Identifier: CDDL-1.0+ SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT E.4 Representing multiple licenses Multiple licenses can be represented using an SPDX license expression as defined in Annex D . A set of licenses may optionally be enclosed in parentheses, but are not required to be enclosed. As further described there: When there is a choice between licenses (\"disjunctive license\"), they should be separated with \"OR\". If presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new license expression. Similarly when multiple licenses need to be simultaneously applied (\"conjunctive license\"), they should be separated with \"AND\". If required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression. In some cases, a set of license terms apply except under special circumstances, in this case, use the \"WITH\" operator followed by one of the recognized exception identifiers . The expression MUST be on a single line, and MUST NOT include a line break in the middle of the expression. Examples: SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only OR MIT SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-2-Clause SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2 Please see Annex D for more examples and details of the license expression specific syntax. If you can\u2019t express the license(s) as an expression using identifiers from the SPDX list, it is probably best to just put the text of your license header in the file (if there is a standard header), or refer to a neutral site URL where the text can be found. To request a license be added to the SPDX License List, please follow the process described here: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md . Alternatively, you can use a LicenseRef- custom license identifier to refer to a license that is not on the SPDX License List, such as the following: SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-my-special-license The LicenseRef- format is defined in Annex D . When using a custom LicenseRef- identifier, you will also need to provide a way for others to determine what license text corresponds to it. Version 3.0 of the REUSE Software Specification provides a standardized format that can optionally be used for providing the corresponding license text for these identifiers.","title":"Using SPDX short identifiers in Source Files"},{"location":"annexes/using-SPDX-short-identifiers-in-source-files/#annex-e-using-spdx-license-list-short-identifiers-in-source-files-informative","text":"TODO: update for SPDXv3","title":"Annex E: Using SPDX license list short identifiers in source files (Informative)"},{"location":"annexes/using-SPDX-short-identifiers-in-source-files/#e1-introduction","text":"Identifying the license for open source software is critical for both reporting purposes and license compliance.

TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 1) Definitions a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License. c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership. d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License. e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast. f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work. g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium. 2) Fair Dealing Rights . Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws. 3) License Grant . Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\"; c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. e. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes . The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. 4) Restrictions . The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5) Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6) Limitation on Liability . EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7) Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8) Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.","title":"Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported"},{"location":"licenses/CC-BY-3.0/#creative-commons-attribution-license-30-unported","text":"License THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\").

For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\"; c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. e.

The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. 4) Restrictions . The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5) Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6) Limitation on Liability . EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7) Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8) Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.","title":"Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported"},{"location":"licenses/Community-Spec-1.0/","text":"Community Specification License 1.0 The Purpose of this License.

As a Result of a Draft Specification Becoming an Approved Specification. Prior to the adoption of a Draft Specification as an Approved Specification, Contributor may exclude Necessary Claims from its licensing commitments under this Agreement by issuing an Exclusion Notice. Contributor may not issue an Exclusion Notice for patents that were eligible to have been excluded pursuant to Section 3.1. 4. Source Code License. Any source code developed by the Working Group is solely subject the source code license included in the Working Group\u2019s repository for that code. If no source code license is included, the source code will be subject to the MIT License. 5. No Other Rights. Except as specifically set forth in this License, no other express or implied patent, trademark, copyright, or other rights are granted under this License, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel. 6. Antitrust Compliance. Contributor acknowledge that it may compete with other participants in various lines of business and that it is therefore imperative that they and their respective representatives act in a manner that does not violate any applicable antitrust laws and regulations. This License does not restrict any Contributor from engaging in similar specification development projects. Each Contributor may design, develop, manufacture, acquire or market competitive deliverables, products, and services, and conduct its business, in whatever way it chooses. No Contributor is obligated to announce or market any products or services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Contributors agree not to have any discussion relating to any product pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, division of markets, allocation of customers or any other topic that should not be discussed among competitors under the auspices of the Working Group. 7. Non-Circumvention. Contributor agrees that it will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of circumventing any obligations under this License. 8.

IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. Any obligations regarding the transfer, successors in interest, or assignment of Necessary Claims will be satisfied if Contributor or Licensee notifies the transferee or assignee of any patent that it knows contains Necessary Claims or necessary claims under this License. Nothing in this License requires Contributor to undertake a patent search. If Contributor is 1) employed by or acting on behalf of an employer, 2) is making a Contribution under the direction or control of a third party, or 3) is making the Contribution as a consultant, contractor, or under another similar relationship with a third party, Contributor represents that they have been authorized by that party to enter into this License on its behalf. 8.2.

A hasDeclaredLicense may be expressed differently in practice for different types of Software Artifacts. For example: for Packages: would include license info for the Package as a whole, found in the Package itself (e.g., LICENSE file, README file, metadata in the Package, etc.) would not include any license information that is not in the Package itself (e.g., license information from the project's website or from a third party repository or website) for Files: would include license info found in the File itself (e.g., license header or notice, comments indicating the license, SPDX-License-Identifier expression) would not include license info found in a different file (e.g., LICENSE file in the top directory of a repository) for Snippets: would include license info found in the Snippet itself (e.g., license notice, comments, SPDX-License-Identifier expression) would not include license info found elsewhere in the File or in a different File (e.g., comment at top of File if it is not within the Snippet, LICENSE file in the top directory of a repository) A hasDeclaredLicense relationship to NoneLicense indicates that the corresponding Package, File or Snippet contains no license information whatsoever. A hasDeclaredLicense relationship to NoAssertionLicense indicates that one of the following applies: the SPDX data creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination; the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or the SPDX data creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so). If a hasDeclaredLicense relationship is not present, no assumptions can be made about whether or not a hasDeclaredLicense exists. Note that a missing hasDeclaredLicense is not the same as a relationship to NoAssertionLicense since the latter is a \"known unknown\" whereas no assumptions can be made from a missing hasDeclaredLicense relationship. hasConcludedLicense A hasConcludedLicense is the license identified by the SPDX data creator, based on analyzing the license information in the Software Artifact and other information to arrive at a reasonably objective conclusion as to what license governs the Software Artifact. A hasConcludedLicense relationship to NoneLicense indicates that the SPDX data creator has looked and did not find any license information for this Software Artifact. A hasConcludedLicense relationship to NoAssertionLicense indicates that one of the following applies: the SPDX data creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination; the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or the SPDX data creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so). If a hasConcludedLicense is not present, no assumptions can be made about whether or not a hasConcludedLicense exists. Note that a missing hasConcludedLicense is not the same as a relationship to a NoAssertionLicense since the latter is a \"known unknown\" whereas no assumptions can be made from a missing hasConcludedLicense relationship.","title":"Description"},{"location":"model/Licensing/Licensing/#metadata","text":"https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.1/terms/Licensing Name Licensing","title":"Metadata"},{"location":"model/Licensing/Licensing/#profile-conformance","text":"For an element collection to be conformant with this profile, the following has to hold: for every /Software/SoftwareArtifact there MUST exist exactly one /Core/Relationship of type hasConcludedLicense having that element as its from property and an /SimpleLicensing/AnyLicenseInfo as its to property.","title":"Profile conformance"},{"location":"model/Lite/Lite/","text":"Lite Summary The SPDX Lite profile defines a subset of the SPDX specification, from the point of view of use cases in some industries.
