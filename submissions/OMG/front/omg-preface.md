# Preface

## OMG

Founded in 1989, the Object Management Group, Inc. (OMG) is an open membership,
not-for-profit computer industry standards consortium that produces and
maintains computer industry specifications for interoperable, portable, and
reusable enterprise applications in distributed, heterogeneous environments.
Membership includes Information Technology vendors, end users, government
agencies, and academia.

OMG member companies write, adopt, and maintain its specifications following a
mature, open process. OMG’s specifications implement the Model Driven
Architecture® (MDA®), maximizing ROI through a full-lifecycle approach to
enterprise integration that covers multiple operating systems, programming
languages, middleware and networking infrastructures, and software development
environments. OMG’s specifications include: UML® (Unified Modeling Language™);
CORBA® (Common Object Request Broker Architecture); CWM™ (Common Warehouse
Metamodel); and industry-specific standards for dozens of vertical markets.
