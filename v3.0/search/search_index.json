This is a follow on from ISO/IEC 5962:2021 Information technology \u2014 SPDX\u00ae Specification V2.2.1 , and includes new fields. Earlier editions were published by the SPDX workgroup via the Linux Foundation. The SPDX Specification was subsequently transposed into the Joint Development Foundation. [Those earlier editions are: 1.0 (August 2011), 1.1 (August 2012), 1.2 (October 2013), 2.0 (May 2015), 2.1 (November 2016), and 2.2 (May 2020).] Differences between this edition and earlier ones are reported in Annex J ; see also [1] . 4.2 Obsolete features Over the life of a standard, some older approaches can become obsolete and are dropped from subsequent editions, possibly with a replacement approach being provided. Such action involves deprecating those outdated features. This edition identifies all currently deprecated features. No features present in 2.2.1 have been deprecated in this 2.3 release. 4.3 Alternate notation for some conformance requirements This standard contains more than a few cardinality assertions , each of which indicates absolute, optional, or conditional requirements. Here are some examples: Cardinality: Mandatory, one. Cardinality: Optional, one or many. Cardinality: Mandatory, one if {condition} is true or {feature} omitted, zero (shall be omitted) if {condition} is false. Cardinality: 0..1 Cardinality: 0..* Cardinality: 1..1 Cardinality: 1..* Each of these assertions can easily be understood as to whether a feature is required, and if so, how many occurrences are required; also, whether a feature is permitted, and if so, in what number. As this is the format long familiar to the SPDX community, it has been preserved in this document. 4.4 Standard data format requirements The data format specification and recommendations are subject to the following constraints: Shall be in a human readable form. Shall be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write. Shall be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness automatically, independent of how it was generated (human or tool). The SPDX document character set shall support UTF-8 encoding. Multiple serialization formats may be used to represent the information being exchanged. Current supported formats include: YAML 1.2 see: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) see: ECMA-404 The JSON Schema for SPDX can be found in the SPDX Spec Git Repository Schema directory Resource Description Framework (RDF also referred to as RDF/XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/ tag:value flat text file as described in this specification .xls spreadsheets In addition to the supported formats, the following format is in development with a plan to complete the specification in the next release: Extensible Markup Language (XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/ Interoperability between all the supported file formats shall be preserved. SPDX defines how to validate a document in each supported format, and how to translate a valid document without loss to each other supported format. Tags and format properties are case sensitive. Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file. A suggested naming convention is: Format Extension tag:value *.spdx RDF *.spdx.rdf JSON *.spdx.json XML *.spdx.xml YAML *.spdx.yaml or *.spdx.yml The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use rdf:about=\"...\" to represent that a proper Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) should be present. 4.5 Trademark Compliance To be designated an SPDX document, a file shall comply with the requirements of the SPDX Trademark License (See the SPDX Trademark Page ).

The data model is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) extensible knowledge representation data model, which provides a flexible and extensible way to represent and exchange information. The data may be serialized in a variety of formats for storage and transmission. 4.2 RDF Serialization Since the data model is based on RDF, any SPDX data can be serialized in any of the multiple RDF serialization formats, including but not limited to: - JSON-LD format as defined in JSON-LD 1.1 ; - Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) format as defined in RDF 1.1 Turtle ; - N-Triples format as defined in RDF 1.1 N-Triples ; and - RDF/XML format as defined in RDF 1.1 XML Syntax . The SPDX specification is accompanied by a JSON-LD context definition file that can be used to serialize SPDX in a much simpler and more human-readable JSON-LD format. 4.3 Canonical serialization Canonical serialization is single, consistent, normalized, deterministic, and reproducible form. Such a canonical form normalizes things like ordering and formatting. The content of the canonical serialization is exactly the same as the JSON-LD serialization of RDF data (see 4.2), just represented in a consistent way. Canonical serialization is in JSON format, as defined in RFC 8259 (IETF STD 90), with the following additional characteristics: no line breaks key names MUST be wrapped in double quotes no whitespace outside of strings true, false and null: the literal names must be lowercase; no other literal names are allowed integers: represented in base 10 using decimal digits. This designates an integer component that may be prefixed with an optional minus sign. Leading zeros are not allowed. strings: UTF-8 representation without specific canonicalisation. A string begins and ends with quotation marks (%x22). Any Unicode characters may be placed within the quotation marks, except for the two characters that MUST be escaped by a reverse solidus: quotation mark, reverse solidus, and the control characters (U+0000 through U+001F). arrays: An array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero or more items. Items are separated by commas. objects: An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets surrounding zero or more name/value pairs (or members). A name is a string containing only ASCII characters (0x21-0x7F). The names within an object must be unique. A single colon comes after each name, separating the name from the value.

A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-3-Clause). SPDX License Expressions provide a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef- [idString] ; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g., AND , OR , WITH and + ). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid SPDX License Expression in this section. The exact syntax of license expressions is described below in ABNF . idstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" ) license-id = <short form license identifier in Annex A.1> license-exception-id = <short form license exception identifier in Annex A.2> license-ref = [\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"(idstring) addition-ref = [\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]\"AdditionRef-\"(idstring) simple-expression = license-id / license-id\"+\" / license-ref addition-expression = license-exception-id / addition-ref compound-expression = (simple-expression / simple-expression ( \"WITH\" / \"with\" ) addition-expression / compound-expression ( \"AND\" / \"and\" ) compound-expression / compound-expression ( \"OR\" / \"or\" ) compound-expression / \"(\" compound-expression \")\" ) license-expression = (simple-expression / compound-expression) In the following sections we describe in more detail <license-expression> construct, a licensing expression string that enables a more accurate representation of the licensing terms of modern-day software. A valid <license-expression> string consists of either: (i) a simple license expression, such as a single license identifier; or (ii) a more complex expression constructed by combining smaller valid expressions using Boolean license operators. There MUST NOT be white space between a license-id and any following + . This supports easy parsing and backwards compatibility. There MUST be white space on either side of the operator \"WITH\". There MUST be white space and/or parentheses on either side of the operators AND and OR . In the tag:value format, a license expression MUST be on a single line, and MUST NOT include a line break in the middle of the expression. D.2 Case sensitivity License expression operators ( AND , and , OR , or , WITH and with ) should be matched in a case-sensitive manner, i.e., letters must be all upper case or all lower case. License identifiers (including license exception identifiers) used in SPDX documents or source code files should be matched in a case-insensitive manner. In other words, MIT , Mit and mIt should all be treated as the same identifier and referring to the same license. However, please be aware that it is often important to match with the case of the canonical identifier on the SPDX License List . This is because the canonical identifier's case is used in the URL of the license's or exception's entry on the List, and because the canonical identifier is translated to a URI in RDF documents. D.3 Simple license expressions A simple <license-expression> is composed one of the following: An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier. For example: CDDL-1.0 An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier with a unary \"+\" operator suffix to represent the current version of the license or any later version. For example: CDDL-1.0+ An SPDX user defined license reference: [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring) Some examples: LicenseRef-23 LicenseRef-MIT-Style-1 DocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2:LicenseRef-MIT-Style-2 The current set of valid license identifiers can be found in spdx.org/licenses . D.4 Composite license expressions D.4.1 Introduction More expressive composite license expressions can be constructed using \"OR\", \"AND\", and \"WITH\" operators similar to constructing mathematical expressions using arithmetic operators. For the tag:value format, any license expression that consists of more than one license identifier and/or LicenseRef, may optionally be encapsulated by parentheses: \"( )\". Nested parentheses can also be used to specify an order of precedence which is discussed in more detail in D.4.5 . D.4.2 Disjunctive \"OR\" operator If presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are valid license expression values. For example, when given a choice between the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT The \"OR\" operator is commutative, meaning that the above expression should be considered equivalent to: MIT OR LGPL-2.1-only An example representing a choice between three different licenses would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT OR BSD-3-Clause It is allowed to use the operator in lower case form or . D.4.3 Conjunctive \"AND\" operator If required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are a valid license expression values. For example, when one is required to comply with both the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT The \"AND\" operator is commutative, meaning that the above expression should be considered equivalent to: MIT AND LGPL-2.1-only An example where all three different licenses apply would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause It is allowed to use the operator in lower case form and . D.4.4 Additive \"WITH\" operator Sometimes license texts are found with additional text, which might or might not modify the original license terms. In this case, use the binary \"WITH\" operator to construct a new license expression to represent the special situation. A valid <license-expression> is where the left operand is a <simple-expression> value and the right operand is a <addition-expression> that represents the additional text. The <addition-expression> can be either a <license-exception-id> from the SPDX License List, or a user defined addition reference in the form [\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]\"AdditonRef-\"(idstring) For example, when the Bison exception is to be applied to GPL-2.0-or-later, the expression would be: GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2 The current set of valid license exceptions identifiers can be found in spdx.org/licenses . It is allowed to use the operator in lower case form with . D.4.5 Order of precedence and parentheses The order of application of the operators in an expression matters (similar to mathematical operators). The default operator order of precedence of a <license-expression> a is: + WITH AND OR where a lower order operator is applied before a higher order operator. For example, the following expression: LGPL-2.1-only OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT represents a license choice between either LGPL-2.1-only and the expression BSD-3-Clause AND MIT because the AND operator takes precedence over (is applied before) the OR operator. When required to express an order of precedence that is different from the default order a <license-expression> can be encapsulated in pairs of parentheses: ( ), to indicate that the operators found inside the parentheses takes precedence over operators outside. This is also similar to the use of parentheses in an algebraic expression e.g., (5+7)/2. For instance, the following expression: MIT AND (LGPL-2.1-or-later OR BSD-3-Clause) states the OR operator should be applied before the AND operator. That is, one should first select between the LGPL-2.1-or-later or the BSD-3-Clause license before applying the MIT license. D.4.6 License expressions in RDF A conjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the conjunctive license. Two or more members are required. <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> <spdx:member rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only\"/> <spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about =\"http://example.org#LicenseRef-EternalSurrender\"> <spdx:extractedText> In exchange for using this software, you agree to give its author all your worldly possessions.

Each structural difference will describe the change, describe an approach to translate from 2.3 to 3.0, and provide a rationale for the change. External Document Reference Description of Change The purpose of the SPDX 2.3 structure \u201cExternalDocumentRef\u201d is now covered by two separate structures: NamespaceMap which maps short identifiers used in serializations to full namespace URI\u2019s to support terseness in serialization of element identifiers ExternalMap which maps an element identifier for an element defined externally to verification and location information The externalDocumentRef property on the SpdxDocument has been replaced by import property and namespace property. Another change is the SPDX document checksum field has been replaced with a \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d property on the ElementCollection. The \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d which has 0 or more \u201cIntegrityMethod\u201d which should be the checksum of the SPDX document. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Each ExternalDocumentRef instance will translate as follows: An entry would be created in the Namespace map for the external document namespace The value of the DocumentRef-[idstring] would be used for the prefix property in the NamespaceMap. The value of the documentNamespace appended with a \u201c#\u201d would be used for the namespace in the NamespaceMap. An entry would be created in the ExternalMap for the external document ref A string identifier consisting of the DocumentRef-[idstring] (the same value as the prefix in the NamespaceMap) concatenated with a \u201c:\u201d and then concatenated with \u201cSPDXRef-DOCUMENT\u201d would be used for the externalSpdxId in the ExternalMap. An integrity method of \u201cHash\u201d will be created with the same information as the checksum property and will be referenced using the \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d property on the ExternalMap entry. An entry would be created in the ExternalMap for each element referenced in the current SpdxDocument that is originally specified in the referenced SpdxDocument. A string identifier consisting of the DocumentRef-[idstring] (the same value as the prefix in the NamespaceMap) concatenated with a \u201c:\u201d and then concatenated with the local portion of the element identifier would be used for the externalSpdxId in the ExternalMap A \u201cdefiningDocument\u201d property would be specified containing a string identifier consisting of the DocumentRef-[idstring] concatenated with a \u201c:\u201d and then concatenated with \u201cSPDXRef-DOCUMENT\u201d. This is a shortcut linkage to tie the referenced element to its defining SpdxDocument for verification and location information. Rationale A key difference between SPDX 2.3 and SPDX 3.0 is that in SPDX 2.3 elements are always expressed within or referenced in relation to a single enclosing SpdxDocument while in SPDX 3.0 a key design principle is that all elements may be expressed and referenced independent of any other element including SpdxDocument. This independence is required to support a variety of content exchange and analysis use cases. For example, in SPDX 2.3 if you wish to express even a single package you specify it within an SpdxDocument and its identifier namespace is restricted to the namespace of the SpdxDocument. In SPDX 3.0 you could specify a single package within an SpdxDocument element (or any other subclass of ElementCollection such as Bundle, Bom, Sbom, etc.) but you could also simply specify it on its own without any enclosing collection element. In addition, in SPDX 3.0 the identifier of the package may share a namespace with an enclosing collection element such as SpdxDocument if desired but it is equally valid for it to have any namespace desired unconstrained by any other element namespace whether it is expressed within a collection element such as SpdxDocument or not. In this example, in SPDX 2.3 if you referenced the package within the same SpdxDocument that it is defined in you would utilize the local portion of its identifier and presume that the namespace is the same as the SpdxDocument namespace. If you referenced it from an SpdxDocument other than the one it is defined in you would use an ExternalDocumentRef to specify a prefix name for the other SpdxDocument to be used within the current SpdxDocument, the URI namespace/identifier for the other SpdxDocument, and a checksum for the other SpdxDocument. To reference the package you would then use an identifier combining the external document ref prefix and the local portion of the identifier. The ExternalDocumentRef structure in SPDX 2.3 is based on the presumptions that elements are always defined within SpdxDocuments, that external elements can always be referenced via a containing SpdxDocument and that element identifiers have a namespace from their original containing SpdxDocument. None of these three presumptions hold true for SPDX 3.0 so a slightly modified structure is necessary to support the two use cases previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef in SPDX 2.3: 1) the ability to specify identifier namespace prefixes and accompanying namespaces for SPDX elements to support more terse serialized expression of content with integrity across serialization forms, 2) the ability to specify which elements in the current subclass of ElementCollection (e.g., SpdxDocument) are only referenced from that collection and defined elsewhere, along with details regarding their verification and location. The Namespace map structure in SPDX 3.0 fully supports the namespace prefixing use case for SpdxDocuments previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef but also equally covers the same use case capability for all element types and for any number of element identifier namespaces (in SPDX 3.0 all elements within an SpdxDocument are not required to have the same namespace and can actually be any desired mix of namespaces) to support this capability required in SPDX 3.0. The ExternalMap structure in SPDX 3.0 fully supports the external element (including SpdxDocument elements) referencing use case for SpdxDocuments previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef but also equally covers the same use case capability for any elements whether they were originally defined within an SpdxDocument or not to support this capability required in SPDX 3.0. The ExternalMap structure in SPDX 3.0 provides the ability to specify verification and location details for any element, not just SpdxDocuments, if appropriate but also provides simple linkage, using the \u201cdefiningDocument'' property, from element entries in the ExternalMap to SpdxDocument entries in the ExternalMap where the elements were defined within the SpdxDocument and verification of the elements can be achieved via proxy to the SpdxDocument \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d information (this is how the SPDX 2.3 ExternalDocumentRef structure currently works). Agent Description of Change The creator property in SPDX 2.3 has been replaced by createdBy and createdUsing properties with a type Agent and Tool resp. The supplier property has been replaced by a property suppliedBy with a type Agent. Additional suppliers can be provided with a a relationship to an availableFrom relationship. The originator property type has been replaced with the originatedBy property with a type Agent. An Agent can be a Person, Organization, or Software Agent. It can also just be an Agent if it is not known what specific type an Agent is. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 The SPDX 2.3 creator string would be parsed and the appropriate Person, Organization or Tool would be created depending on if the prefix is \u201cPerson: \u201d, \u201cOrganization:\u201d or \u201cTool: \u201d resp. The required createdBy field for Agent or Tool may point to itself if no other information is available. The createdUsing property would be used for Tool whereas the createdBy property would be used for Person and Organization. The name would map to the \u201cname\u201d property. If an email address is present, it would translate to an external identifier. Note that in 3.0 the createdBy is a required field. There will be situations where only a Tool is provided. In that case, createdBy should point to a SoftwareAgent should be created using the same information as the Tool. Rationale The 3.0 format is more machine readable and structured (e.g. you do not need to parse the type from the string value). It is also more flexible in that an Agent can be used even if it is not known what the Agent type is. File Type Description of Change The FileType enumeration has been replaced by two fields, the media type string as maintained by IANA for the content of the file and an enumeration of SoftwarePurpose for the purpose of the file. The property name fileType has been replaced by a property name contentType. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Rationale One of the things that we identified is that FileType was being used for two things: Describing the purpose of the file. Describing the type of content in the file. For SPDX 3.0 we split this into two properties: SoftwarePurpose to capture the purpose (which is of type SoftwarePurpose ). ContentType to capture the type of content (which is of type MediaType ). The name ContentType was chosen to mirror the Content-Type header in HTTP (which is also of type MediaType) and to express that this is describing the type of content (as opposed to metadata, headers, or something else). For example, if (and not saying we would) we extended File in the future to be able to capture the type of executable header a file has (e.g. ELF), that could also be of type MediaType but the property name might be ExecutableHeaderType . An example conversion table from SPDX 2.3 FileType to SPDX 3.0 ContentType or SoftwarePurpose can look like this: SPDX 2 File Type SPDX 3 Software Purpose SPDX 3 Content Type ARCHIVE Archive BINARY application/octet-stream SOURCE Source TEXT text/plain APPLICATION Application AUDIO audio/* IMAGE image/* VIDEO video/* DOCUMENTATION Documentation SPDX text/spdx OTHER Other Package File Name Description of Change The packageFileName property and packageChecksum property has been replaced by a relationship from a Package to a File. A relationship type of hasDistributionArtifact should be used. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Create an SPDX File with the name from the packageFileName and a verifiedUsing value from the packageChecksum for a single file. If the packageFileName is a directory, then the SPDX File is created with the directory name and is verified using the gitoid property on the File and a fileKind of directory. Create a hasDistributionArifact relationship from the SPDX Package to the SPDX File. Rationale Providing a File relationship to the download location will include more detailed and complete information about the package file name used. External Identifiers Description of Change In SPDX 3.0, a new property externalIdentifiers and a new type ExternalIdentifier is introduced. This is in addition to retaining the ExternalRef property and classes. In SPDX 2.3, both identifiers and references were captured in the externalRef property for packages. In addition to the structural changes, the \u201curl\u201d ExternalRef type was removed and is replaced by the \u201csecurityOther\u201d ExternalRef type. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 The following ExternalRef Types should be converted to ExternalIdentifiers: cpe22Type cpe23Type swid purl swh gitoid All other ExternalRef types should remain as ExternalRef\u2019s. The url ExternalRef type should be converted to a \u201csecurityOther\u201d. Rationale Distinguishing identifiers from references is key to several integrity and provenance use cases. Creating a separate property and type enables easier identification of identifiers. Package URL Description of Change In SPDX 3.0, Package URL is a new property for Artifact which is a superclass of Package. Package URL is an External Ref type in SPDX 2.3. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 If there is a single ExternalReference of type purl without the optional ExternalRef comment property, place that in the packageUrl property. Rationale Package URL is a very common method of identifying software packages. Moving this to a property makes it significantly simpler to find and correlate Package URL identifiers. Annotation Description of Change Annotations are now subclasses of Element, so it inherits a number of new optional properties including names, annotations, and its own relationships. Annotations are no longer a property of an Element. It is now a standalone element with a \u201csubject\u201d field which points to the Element being annotated. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 A new Annotation element would be created for every annotation property in an element (Package, File or Snippet). The subject property would point to the Element which has the Annotation as a property. The annotator from SPDX 2.3 should be translated to one of the creators for the creationInfo for the Annotation and the annotationDate should be translated to the created field in the same creationInfo. The creationInfo for the Annotation should be the creationInfo of the SPDX 2.3 document. The SPDX 2.3 \u201ccomment\u201d should use the statement field in SPDX 3.0. Rationale Changing from a property to a standalone element allows for relationships to exist outside the element itself (e.g. you can now create an amended SPDX document which has a new annotation for an element defined in the original document). This also supports third parties' ability to assert Annotations on Elements that they did not create. Relationship Description of Change The structure of the Relationship class has changed to have a single direction and allow more than one related SPDX Elements. Relationships are now subclasses of Element, so it inherits a number of new optional properties including names, annotations, and its own relationships. Relationships are no longer a property of an Element. It is now a standalone element with a \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d field. A new property \u201ccompleteness' ' complements the use of NONE and NOASSERTION for the related SPDX elements. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 The \u201cfrom\u201d property would be populated by the SPDX Element which has the relationship property. The \u201cto\u201d property will be the relatedSpdxElement. When translating the relationshipType, the \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d may need to be swapped - the table below will have a \u201cY\u201d in the \u201cSwap to and from?\u201d column when this is necessary. The completeness property would be constructed based on the following: \u201cto\u201d value is NONE: complete \u201cto\u201d value is NOASSERTION: noAssertion \u201cto\u201d value is an SPDX element: No value for the completeness - uses the default Relationship migration is being worked out in the relationships spreadsheet. Once completed, the following table will reflect the translation for relationship types from SPDX 2.3 to SPDX 3.0: SPDX 2.3 Relationship Type SPDX 3.0 Relationship Type Swap to and from? LifecycleScopeType AMENDS amendedBy Y ANCESTOR_OF ancestorOf BUILD_DEPENDENCY_OF dependsOn BUILD_TOOL_OF usesTool build (all lifecycle scope could be appropriate) CONTAINED_BY contains Y CONTAINS contains COPY_OF copiedTo DATA_FILE_OF hasDataFile DEPENDENCY_MANIFEST_OF hasDependencyManifest ~~DEPENDENCY_OF~~ [removed] DEPENDS_ON dependsOn various LifecycleScopeType DESCENDANT_OF decendentOf ~~DESCRIBED_BY~~ [removed] DESCRIBES describes DEV_DEPENDENCY_OF dependsOn development DEV_TOOL_OF usesTool development DISTRIBUTION_ARTIFACT hasDistributionArtifact DOCUMENTATION_OF hasDocumentation DYNAMIC_LINK hasDynamicLink build, runtime EXAMPLE_OF hasExample EXPANDED_FROM_ARCHIVE expandsTo FILE_ADDED hasAddedFile FILE_DELETED hasDeletedFile FILE_MODIFIED modifiedBy GENERATED_FROM generates Y GENERATES generates HAS_PREREQUISITE hasPrequisite lifecycle scope METAFILE_OF hasMetadata OPTIONAL_COMPONENT_OF hasOptionalComponent OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY_OF hasOptionalDependency lifecycle scope OTHER other PACKAGE_OF packagedBy ~~PATCH_FOR~~ [removed] ~~PREREQUISITE_FOR [removed] PROVIDED_DEPENDENCY_OF hasProvidedDependency lifecycle scope REQUIREMENT_DESCRIPTION_FOR hasRequirement lifecycle scope RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_OF dependsOn runtime SPECIFICATION_FOR hasSpecification lifecycle scope STATIC_LINK hasStaticLink lifecycle scope TEST_CASE_OF hasTestCase TEST_DEPENDENCY_OF dependsOn test TEST_OF hasTest lifecycle scope TEST_TOOL_OF usesTool test VARIANT_OF hasVarient Rationale The addition of the completeness attribute is clearer than the use of NONE and NOASSERTION. Changing from a property to a standalone element allows for relationships to exist outside the element itself (e.g. you can now create an amended SPDX document which has a new relationship for an element defined in the original document). This enables primary Element creating parties as well as third parties to express significantly greater contextual detail among content they create as well as content created by others. Snippet Description of Change Byte and line range types have been changed from a StartEndPointer type to a PositiveIntegerRange. Byte range is now optional. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Iterate through the \u201cranges\u201d property. Any startPointer and endPointer with a property of \u201coffset\u201d would be translated to a snippetByteRange property. Any startPointer and endPointer with a property of \u201clineNumber\u201d would translate to a snippetLineRange property. A new Relationship would be created with the \u201cfrom\u201d pointing to the snippetFromFile and the \u201cto\u201d pointing to the Snippet. They relationshipType would be CONTAINS. Rationale Using the W3C Pointer standard introduced significant complexity in the SPDX 2.X specification. Although there may be some benefit in using a published standard, we have not found any instances where the W3C Pointer ontology was useful for SPDX use cases. Changing the snippetFromFile from a property to a relationship [to be filled in]. SpecVersion Description of Change The type of SpecVerion is changed from a simple string without constraints to a SemVer string which must follow the Semantic Versioning format . This adds a constraint where a patch version is required. Previous usage of the SpecVersiononly included the major and minor version. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Add a patch version of \u201c0\u201d to any previous spec version. Rationale The additional constraints align with best practices for versioning strings. LicenseListVersion Description of Change The type of LicenseListVersion is changed from a simple string without constraints to a SemVer string which must follow the Semantic Versioning format . This adds a constraint where a patch version is required. Previous usage of the SPDX license list only included the major and minor version. Translating from 2.3 to 3.0 Add a patch version of \u201c0\u201d to any previous license list version. Rationale The additional constraints align with best practices for versioning strings. Properties Removed Below is a list of properties present in 2.3 and not present in 3.0. The Range / Where used is where the property was used in the SPDX 2.3 model. example SPDX 2.3 Model Name example Tag/Value Name Not used Range / Where Used LicenseException Rationale This field has not been used. LicenseInfoInFiles SPDX 2.3 Model Name licenseInfoInFiles Tag/Value Name LicenseInfoInFiles Range / Where Used Package Rationale This field is redundant with the declaredLicense property in the Files contained in the Package. It is recommended that the licenseInfoInFiles can be added as an Annotation to the Package in the format: \u201cSPDX 2.X LicenseInfoInFiles: [expression1], [expression2]\u201d where the [expressions] are the string representation of the license expressions. FilesAnalyzed SPDX 2.3 Model Name filesAnalyzed Tag/Value Name FilesAnalyzed Range / Where Used Package Rationale Many users of the SPDX 2.X spec reported this property as very confusing. NOTE: There is no longer a way to specific checksums are required for files. This is being tracked in Issue #84 . Naming Differences Below is a list of properties and classes where the name has been changed from 2.3 to 3.0. The Range / Where used is where the property was used in the SPDX 2.3 model. Release Date SPDX 2.3 Model Name releaseDate Tag/Value Name ReleaseDate New Name releaseTime Range / Where Used Package Rationale Better reflects the granularity of the field. Build Date SPDX 2.3 Model Name buildDate Tag/Value Name BuildDate New Name buildTime Range / Where Used Package Rationale Better reflects the granularity of the field. Valid Until Date SPDX 2.3 Model Name validUntilDate Tag/Value Name ValidUntilDate New Name validUntilTime Range / Where Used Package Rationale Better reflects the granularity of the field. External Document Reference SPDX 2.3 Model Name externalDocumentRef Tag/Value Name ExternalDocumentRef New Name import Range / Where Used SpdxDocument (Creation Information) Rationale Feedback from SPDX 2.X usage is that externalDocumentRef is confusing due to the similar externalRef property. NOTE: See structural changes related to this property Checksum Class / Data Type SPDX 2.3 Model Name Checksum class name and checksum property name Tag/Value Name FileChecksum, PackageChecksum New Name verifiedUsing property and Hash class Range / Where Used Package, File Rationale More general concept allowing for different verification algorithms for different scenarios. Checksum Algorithm SPDX 2.3 Model Name checksumAlgorithm Tag/Value Name N/A - parsed from a string following the Checksum: keyword. New Name hashAlgorithm Range / Where Used Package, File Rationale The term \u201chash\u201d better represents the intent of this property which is to validate the integrity of the data whereas the term \u201cchecksum\u201d is typically for the purpose of error checking. Name SPDX 2.3 Model Name packageName, fileName Tag/Value Name PackageName, FileName New Name name Range / Where Used Package, File Rationale In the SPDX 2.3 RDF Ontology, both spdx:fileName and spdx:packageName are sub-properties of spdx:name. The OWL has a restriction that spdx:File has exactly one spdx:fileName and spdx:Package has exactly one spdx:packageName. Changing these restrictions to just spdx:name would simplify the model. Version SPDX 2.3 Model Name versionInfo Tag/Value Name PackageVersion New Name packageVersion Range / Where Used Package Rationale This change would make the Tag/Value and RDF values consistent. Home Page SPDX 2.3 Model Name doap:homepage Tag/Value Name PackageHomePage New Name homePage Range / Where Used Rationale Uses a consistent namespace for SPDX properties. Annotation Comment SPDX 2.3 Model Name rdfs:comment Tag/Value Name AnnotationComment New Name statement Range / Where Used Element (Package, File, Snippet) Rationale The rdfs:comment property is optional and has slightly different semantics in other uses (e.g. comments on Elements). Changing the property name clearly distinguishes this usage as a mandatory property for an Annotation. With Exception Operator SPDX 2.3 Model Name WithExceptionOperator member property in WithExceptionOperator licenseException property in WithExceptionOperator Tag/Value Name With (part of License Expression) New Name WithAdditionOperator subjectLicense subjectAddition Range / Where Used Package, File, Snippet Rationale Custom Additions have been added in SPDX 3.0 which operate in a similar manner to listed License Exceptions. The new type and property names are more general to accommodate both custom additions and listed license Exceptions. License Exception SPDX 2.3 Model Name LicenseException licenseExceptionId property in LicenseException licenseExceptionText property in LicenseException name property in LicenseException Tag/Value Name Not used in Tag/Value New Name ListedLicenseException additionId additionText additionName Range / Where Used Package, File, Snippet Rationale Custom Additions have been added in SPDX 3.0 which operate in a similar manner to listed License Exceptions. The new type and property names are more general to accommodate both custom additions and listed license Exceptions. ExtractedLicenseInfo SPDX 2.3 Model Name ExtractedLicenseInfo Tag/Value Name ExtractedText New Name CustomLicense Range / Where Used Package, File, Snippet, Document Rationale The SPDX 2.X term implied that the only property was text when in fact there are several properties in common with the listed licenses. See model issue #233 for context. licenseComment SPDX 2.3 Model Name licenseComment Tag/Value Name LicenseName New Name name Range / Where Used License, ListedLicense, ExtractedText Rationale \u201cname\u201d is used in the Element class. Since License is a type of (subclass of) Element, it should use the same field otherwise there would be redundant fields for the same purpose. LicenseComment SPDX 2.3 Model Name licenseComment Tag/Value Name LicenseComment New Name comment Range / Where Used License, ListedLicense Rationale \u201ccomment\u201d is used in the Element class. Since License is a type of (subclass of) Element, it should use the same field otherwise there would be redundant fields for the same purpose. LicenseID SPDX 2.3 Model Name licenseId Tag/Value Name LicenseId New Name spdxId Range / Where Used License, ListedLicense Rationale \u201cspdxId\u201d is used in the Element class. Since License is a type of (subclass of) Element, it should use the same field otherwise there would be redundant fields for the same purpose. Range / Where Used License, ListedLicense Rationale Primary Package Purpose SPDX 2.3 Model Name primaryPackagePurpose Tag/Value Name PrimaryPackagePurpose New Name primaryPurpose Range / Where Used Package Rationale The purpose property is now available for files and snippets in addition to Package resulting in a more general name of primaryPurpose. Note that additional purposes can be added using the additionalPurpose property. Serialization Formats SPDX 3.0 implements a JSON-LD format which has consistent class and property names with the model. See the SPDX 3.0 JSON Schema for the format specifics. The Tag/Value, YAML, RDF/XML and Spreadsheet formats are not supported. Additional serialization formats are being considered for the SPDX 3.1 release. I.2 Differences between V2.3 and V2.2.2 V2.3 has added new fields to improve the ability to capture security related information and to improve interoperabiility with other SBOM formats. Key changes include: Added fields to Clause 7 ( Package Information ) to describe \"Primary Package Purpose\" and standardize recording of \"Built Date\", \"Release Date\", \"Valid Until Date\". Added hash algorithms (SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, BLAKE2b-256, BLAKE2b-384, BLAKE2b-512, BLAKE3, ADLER32 ) to the set recognized by 7.10 (Package Checksum field) and 8.4 (File checksum field) Update Clause 7, 8, and 9 to make several of the licensing properties optional rather than requiring the use of \"NOASSERTION\" when no value is provided. Update Clause 11 to add the new relationship types: REQUIREMENT_DESCRIPTION_FOR and SPECIFICATION_FOR. Update Annex B ( License matching guidelines and templates ) to use the License List XML format Update Annex F ( External Repository Identifiers ) to expand security references to include advisory, fix, URL, SWID. Expand persistent identifiers to include gitoid. Update Annex G ( SPDX Lite Profile ) to include NTIA SBOM mandatory minimum fields as required. Update Annex H to documented how the snippet information in files to be consistent with REUSE recommendations. Added Annex K ( How To Use SPDX in Different Scenarios ) to illustrate linking to external security information, and illustrate how the NTIA SBOM mandatory minimum elements map to SPDX fields. I.3 Differences between V2.2.2 and V2.2.1 V2.2.2 fixed formatting, grammatical and spelling issues found since ISO/IEC 5962:2021 SPDX v2.2.1 was published. No new fields were added. Key changes include: Clarify Optional Cardinality contradictions Update OWL document Update JSON schema to fix typos and add missing required fields. Clarify Information on using License List short form identifiers. It fixed annex lettering inconsistencies. It also moved CC-BY-3.0 to the end of the spec to keep annex letters more consistent in future versions. Here is the translation between lettering in V2.2.2 and the version that came before it: Table I.1 \u2014 SPDX V2.2.2 Organizational Changes Title V2.2.1 ( spdx.dev ) V2.2.1 (ISO) V2.2.2 SPDX Lite Annex H/G* Annex G Annex G SPDX File Tags Annex I/H* Annex H Annex H Differences from Earlier SPDX Versions Annex J/I* Annex I Annex I Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported Annex G [omitted] Annex J [omitted in ISO version] * This edition featured inconsistent lettering. I.4 Differences between V2.2.1 and V2.2 There were no technical differences; V2.2.1 is V2.2 reformatted for submission to ISO via the PAS process. As a result, new clauses were added causing the previous clause-numbering sequence to change. Also, Annexes went from having Roman numbers to Latin letters. Here is the translation between numbering in V2.2.1 and the version that came before it: Table I.2 \u2014 SPDX V2.2.1 Organizational Changes Title V2.2 V2.2.1 ( spdx.dev ) V2.2.1 (ISO) Scope N/A Clause 1 Clause 1 Normative references N/A Clause 2 Clause 2 Terms and definitions N/A Clause 3 Clause 3 Conformance N/A Clause 4 Clause 4 Composition of an SPDX document N/A Clause 5 Clause 5 Document Creation Information Chapter 2 Clause 6 Clause 6 Package Information Chapter 3 Clause 7 Clause 7 File Information Chapter 4 Clause 8 Clause 8 Snippet Information Chapter 5 Clause 9 Clause 9 Other Licensing Information Detected Chapter 6 Clause 10 Clause 1 Relationship between SPDX Elements Information Chapter 7 Clause 11 Clause 1 Annotation Information Chapter 8 Clause 12 Clause 1 Review Information (deprecated) Chapter 9 Clause 13 Clause 1 SPDX License List Appendix I Annex A Annex A License Matching Guidelines and Templates Appendix II Annex B Annex B RDF Object Model and Identifier Syntax Appendix III Annex C Annex C SPDX License Expressions Appendix IV Annex D Annex D Using SPDX short identifiers in Source Files Appendix V Annex E Annex E External Repository Identifiers Appendix VI Annex F Annex F Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported Appendix VII Annex G [omitted] SPDX Lite Appendix VIII Annex H/G* Annex G SPDX File Tags Appendix IX Annex I/H* Annex H Differences from Earlier SPDX Versions N/A Annex J/I* Annex I * This edition featured inconsistent lettering. I.5 Differences from V2.2 and V2.1 JSON, YAML, and a development version of XML have been added as supported file formats. A new appendix \"SPDX File Tags\" has been added to describe a method that developers can use to document other SPDX file-specific information (such as copyright notices, file type, etc.) in a standardized and easily machine-readable manner. See Appendix IX for more information. A new appendix \"SPDX Lite\" has been added to document a lightweight subset of the SPDX specification for scenarios where a full SPDX document is not required. See Appendix VIII for more information. Additional relationship options have been added to enable expression of different forms of dependencies between SPDX elements. As well, NONE and NOASSERTION keywords are now permitted to be used with relationships to indicate what is unknown. Miscellaneous bug fixes and non-breaking improvements as reported on the mailing list and reported as issues on the spdx-spec GitHub repository. I.6 Differences between V2.1 and V2.0 Snippets have been added to allow a portion of a file to be identified as having different properties from the file it resides in. The use of snippets is completely optional and it is not mandatory for snippets to be identified. See section 5 Snippet Information for further details on the fields available to describe snippets. External Packages can now be referred to in SPDX documents. When there is no SPDX file information available to document the content of these external packages, then the filesAnalyzed attribute on a package should be set to false. See section 3.8 Files Analyzed for more information. Packages are now able to associate with an \u201cExternal Reference\u201d which allows a Package to reference an external source of additional information, metadata, enumerations, asset identifiers, or downloadable content believed to be relevant to the Package. See: section 3.21 External Reference, 3.22 External Reference Comment and Appendix VI: External Repository Identifiers for more information. The \u201cArtifact of Project\u201d fields at the file level are now deprecated, as they can be replaced by a relationship to the more descriptive External Packages. A new appendix \u201cUsing SPDX short identifiers in Source Files\u201d has been added to document the best practices to refer to the licenses in the SPDX license list that have emerged from the development community. See Appendix V: Using SPDX short identifiers in Source Files for more information. Miscellaneous bug fixes. I.7 Differences between V2.0 and V1.2 Abstraction has been applied to the underlying model with the inclusion of SPDX elements. With SPDX 2.0, the concept of an SPDX element is introduced (see Appendix III). This includes SPDX documents, SPDX files, and SPDX packages, each of which gets associated with an SPDX identifier which is denoted by \u201cSPDXRef-\u201d. SPDX relationships have been added to allow any SPDX element to have a relationship to other SPDX elements. Documented the origin of an SPDX hierarchy of sub-packages, documenting the origin of an SPDX element, and documenting modifications or corrections (annotations) to an SPDX element. The ability to reference SPDX elements outside the current SPDX document itself (external references). Additional file types are now supported. Additional checksum algorithms are now supported. Review Information section is deprecated. It is recommended to provide document reviews with Annotations (Section 7). A License Expression Syntax has been introduced and documented in Appendix IV.","title":"Diffs from Previous Editions"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#annex-i-differences-from-previous-editions-informative","text":"","title":"Annex I Differences from previous editions (Informative)"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#i1-differences-between-v30-and-v23","text":"","title":"I.1 Differences between V3.0 and V2.3"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#structural-differences","text":"These are the most significant breaking changes requiring a change in logic to handle a different model or structure for the information.

This is a shortcut linkage to tie the referenced element to its defining SpdxDocument for verification and location information.","title":"Translating from 2.3 to 3.0"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#rationale","text":"A key difference between SPDX 2.3 and SPDX 3.0 is that in SPDX 2.3 elements are always expressed within or referenced in relation to a single enclosing SpdxDocument while in SPDX 3.0 a key design principle is that all elements may be expressed and referenced independent of any other element including SpdxDocument. This independence is required to support a variety of content exchange and analysis use cases. For example, in SPDX 2.3 if you wish to express even a single package you specify it within an SpdxDocument and its identifier namespace is restricted to the namespace of the SpdxDocument. In SPDX 3.0 you could specify a single package within an SpdxDocument element (or any other subclass of ElementCollection such as Bundle, Bom, Sbom, etc.) but you could also simply specify it on its own without any enclosing collection element. In addition, in SPDX 3.0 the identifier of the package may share a namespace with an enclosing collection element such as SpdxDocument if desired but it is equally valid for it to have any namespace desired unconstrained by any other element namespace whether it is expressed within a collection element such as SpdxDocument or not. In this example, in SPDX 2.3 if you referenced the package within the same SpdxDocument that it is defined in you would utilize the local portion of its identifier and presume that the namespace is the same as the SpdxDocument namespace. If you referenced it from an SpdxDocument other than the one it is defined in you would use an ExternalDocumentRef to specify a prefix name for the other SpdxDocument to be used within the current SpdxDocument, the URI namespace/identifier for the other SpdxDocument, and a checksum for the other SpdxDocument. To reference the package you would then use an identifier combining the external document ref prefix and the local portion of the identifier. The ExternalDocumentRef structure in SPDX 2.3 is based on the presumptions that elements are always defined within SpdxDocuments, that external elements can always be referenced via a containing SpdxDocument and that element identifiers have a namespace from their original containing SpdxDocument. None of these three presumptions hold true for SPDX 3.0 so a slightly modified structure is necessary to support the two use cases previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef in SPDX 2.3: 1) the ability to specify identifier namespace prefixes and accompanying namespaces for SPDX elements to support more terse serialized expression of content with integrity across serialization forms, 2) the ability to specify which elements in the current subclass of ElementCollection (e.g., SpdxDocument) are only referenced from that collection and defined elsewhere, along with details regarding their verification and location. The Namespace map structure in SPDX 3.0 fully supports the namespace prefixing use case for SpdxDocuments previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef but also equally covers the same use case capability for all element types and for any number of element identifier namespaces (in SPDX 3.0 all elements within an SpdxDocument are not required to have the same namespace and can actually be any desired mix of namespaces) to support this capability required in SPDX 3.0. The ExternalMap structure in SPDX 3.0 fully supports the external element (including SpdxDocument elements) referencing use case for SpdxDocuments previously covered by ExternalDocumentRef but also equally covers the same use case capability for any elements whether they were originally defined within an SpdxDocument or not to support this capability required in SPDX 3.0. The ExternalMap structure in SPDX 3.0 provides the ability to specify verification and location details for any element, not just SpdxDocuments, if appropriate but also provides simple linkage, using the \u201cdefiningDocument'' property, from element entries in the ExternalMap to SpdxDocument entries in the ExternalMap where the elements were defined within the SpdxDocument and verification of the elements can be achieved via proxy to the SpdxDocument \u201cverifiedUsing\u201d information (this is how the SPDX 2.3 ExternalDocumentRef structure currently works).","title":"Rationale"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#agent","text":"","title":"Agent"},{"location":"annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions/#description-of-change_1","text":"The creator property in SPDX 2.3 has been replaced by createdBy and createdUsing properties with a type Agent and Tool resp.

Examples: SPDX-License-Identifier: CDDL-1.0+ SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT E.4 Representing multiple licenses Multiple licenses can be represented using an SPDX license expression as defined in Annex D . A set of licenses may optionally be enclosed in parentheses, but are not required to be enclosed.

In some cases, a set of license terms apply except under special circumstances, in this case, use the \"WITH\" operator followed by one of the recognized exception identifiers .

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License. c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership. d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License. e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast. f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work. g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium. 2) Fair Dealing Rights .

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\"; c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. e. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. 4) Restrictions . The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c.

Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5) Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7) Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8) Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.","title":"Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported"},{"location":"licenses/CC-BY-3.0/#creative-commons-attribution-license-30-unported","text":"License THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\").

The consumer of SPDX content wishes to preserve the name space mapping provided by such a producer. In this case, the consumer would record the namespace map prefixes in the NamespaceMap such that subsequent serializations could reproduce the prefixes / namespaces in the native serialization format. 2) An SPDX content producer wishing to maintain consistent prefix use and understanding across multiple different serialization formats of the produced content. For example, an SBOM producer wishes to share/publish the SBOM as JSON-LD and XML.

Classes and Property restrictions are defined in the SimpleLicensingProfile (Classes and Properties associated with string license expressions) and in the ExpandedLicensingProfile (Classes and Properties used for a fully parsed syntax tree of license expressions). There are 2 relationship types related to licensing - declaredLicense and concludedLicense. A declaredLicense identifies the license information actually found in the Software Artifact, for example as detected by use of automated tooling. This field is not intended to capture license information obtained from an external source, such as a package's website. Such information can be included, as needed, in the concludedLicense field. A declaredLicense may be expressed differently in practice for different types of Software Artifacts. For example: for Packages: would include license info for the Package as a whole, found in the Package itself (e.g., LICENSE file, README file, metadata in the Package, etc.) would not include any license information that is not in the Package itself (e.g., license information from the project\u2019s website or from a third party repository or website) for Files: would include license info found in the File itself (e.g., license header or notice, comments indicating the license, SPDX-License-Identifier expression) would not include license info found in a different file (e.g., LICENSE file in the top directory of a repository) for Snippets: would include license info found in the Snippet itself (e.g., license notice, comments, SPDX-License-Identifier expression) would not include license info found elsewhere in the File or in a different File (e.g., comment at top of File if it is not within the Snippet, LICENSE file in the top directory of a repository) A declaredLicense relationship to NoneLicense indicates that the corresponding Package, File or Snippet contains no license information whatsoever. A declaredLicense relationship to NoAssertionLicense indicates that one of the following applies: * the SPDX data creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination; * the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or * the SPDX data creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so). If a declaredLicense relationship is not present, no assumptions can be made about whether or not a declaredLicense exists. Note that a missing declaredLicense is not the same as a relationship to NoAssertionLicense since the latter is a \"known unknown\" whereas no assumptions can be made from a missing declaredLicense relationship. A concludedLicense is the license identified by the SPDX data creator, based on analyzing the license information in the Software Artifact and other information to arrive at a reasonably objective conclusion as to what license governs the Software Artifact. A concludedLicense relationship to NoneLicense indicates that the SPDX data creator has looked and did not find any license information for this Software Artifact. A concludedLicense relationship to NoAssertionLicense indicates that one of the following applies: * the SPDX data creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination; * the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or * the SPDX data creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).
