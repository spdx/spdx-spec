A gitoid may represent the software [Artifact ID](https://github.com/omnibor/spec/blob/main/spec/SPEC.md#artifact-id) or the [OmniBOR Identifier](https://github.com/omnibor/spec/blob/main/spec/SPEC.md#omnibor-identifier) for the software artifact's associated [OmniBOR Document](https://github.com/omnibor/spec/blob/main/spec/SPEC.md#omnibor-document); this ambiguity exists because the OmniBOR Document is itself an artifact, and the gitoid of that artifact is its valid identifier. Omnibor is a minimalistic schema to describe software [Artifact Dependency Graphs](https://github.com/omnibor/spec/blob/main/spec/SPEC.md#artifact-dependency-graph-adg). Gitoids calculated on software artifacts (Snippet, File, or Package Elements) should be recorded in the SPDX 3.0 SoftwareArtifact's ContentIdentifier property.
