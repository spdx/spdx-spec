            "text": "1 Rationale\n\n\n1.1 Charter \n\n\nTo create a set of data exchange standards that enable companies and organizations to share human-readable and machine-processable software package metadata to facilitate software supply chain processes.\n\n\n1.2 Definition \n\n\nThe Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX\u00ae) specification is a standard format for communicating the components, licenses, and copyrights associated with software packages. An SPDX file is associated with a particular software package or set of packages and contains information about it in the SPDX format.\n\n\n1.3 Why is a common format for data exchange needed? \n\n\nCompanies and organizations (collectively \u201cOrganizations\u201d) are widely using and reusing open source and other software packages. Compliance with the associated licenses requires a set of analysis activities and due diligence that each Organization performs independently, which may include a manual and/or automated scan of software and identification of associated licenses followed by manual verification. Software development teams across the globe use the same open source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis activities. As a result, many groups are performing the same work leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information. The SPDX working group seeks to create a data exchange format so that information about software packages and related content may be collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time and improving data accuracy.\n\n\n1.4 What does this specification cover? \n\n\n1.4.1\n SPDX Document Creation Information: Meta data to associate analysis results with a specific version of the SPDX file and license for use, and provide information on how, when, and by whom the SPDX file was created.\n\n\n1.4.2\n Package Information: Facts that are common properties of the entire package.\n\n\n1.4.3\n File Information: Facts that are specific to each file included in the package.\n\n\n1.4.4\n Snippet Information: Facts that are specific to only a part of a file.\n\n\n1.4.5\n Other Licensing Information Detected: A way to capture information about and refer to licenses that are not on the SPDX License List.\n\n\n1.4.6\n Relationships Between SPDX Elements: Information on how Documents, Packages & Files relate to each other.\n\n\n1.4.7\n Annotations: Information about when and by whom the SPDX file was reviewed\n\n\n\n\n1.5 What is not covered in the specification? \n\n\n1.5.1\n Information that cannot be derived from an inspection (whether manual or using automated tools) of the package to be analyzed.\n\n\n1.5.2\n How the data stored in an SPDX file is used by the recipient.\n\n\n1.5.3\n Any identification of any patent(s) which may or may not relate to the package.\n\n\n1.5.4\n Legal interpretation of the licenses or any compliance actions that have been or may need to be taken.\n\n\n1.5.5\n Examples may contain \n...\n which indicate detailed text specific to the SPDX Document\n\n\n1.6 What does \"Package\" mean in the context of SPDX? \n\n\nIn SPDX, a 'Package' refers to any unit of content that can be associated with a distribution of software. Typically, a Package is composed of one or more files. An SPDX document may, but is not required to, provide details about the individual files comprising a Package (see the \"File Information\" details in section 4).\n\n\nAny of the following non-limiting examples may be (but are not required to be) represented in SPDX as a Package:\n* a tarball, zip file or other archive\n* a directory or subdirectory\n* a separately-distributed piece of software which another Package or File uses or depends upon (e.g., a Python package, a Golang module, ...)\n* a container image, and/or each image layer within a container image\n* a collection of one or more sub-packages\n* a Git repository snapshot from a particular point in time\n\n\nNote that some of these could be represented in SPDX as a File as well.\n\n\nIn an SPDX document, Relationship elements can be used to indicate relationships between Packages, such as dependency relationships.\n\n\n1.7 Format Requirements \n\n\n1.7.1\n Must be in a human readable form.\n\n\n1.7.2\n Must be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write.\n\n\n1.7.3\n Must be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness independent of how it was generated (human or tool).\n\n\n1.7.4\n The SPDX file character set must support UTF-8 encoding.\n\n\n1.7.5\n Must permit automated specification syntax validation.\n\n\n1.7.6\n Resource Description Framework (RDF) can be used to represent this information, as can an annotated tag value flat text file.\n\n\n1.7.7\n Interoperability with an annotate \ntag:value\n format and the RDF format will be preserved.\n\n\n1.7.8\n Tags and RDF properties are case sensitive.\n\n\n1.7.9\n Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file. A suggested naming convention is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nExtension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntag:value\n\n\n*.spdx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRDF\n\n\n*.spdx.rdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n\n\n*.spdx.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXML\n\n\n*.spdx.xml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAML\n\n\n.spdx.yaml or \n.spdx.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.10\n The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use \nrdf:about=\"...\"\n to represent that a proper Universal Resource Indicator (URI) should be present.\n\n\n1.8 Conformance \n\n\n1.8.1\n A file can be designated an SPDX document, if it is compliant with the requirements of the SPDX Trademark License (See the SPDX Trademark Page).\n\n\n1.8.2\n The official copyright notice to be used with any verbatim reproduction and/or distribution of this SPDX Specification 2.2-DRAFT is:\n\n\n\"Official SPDX\u00ae Specification 2.2 Copyright \u00a9 2010-2020 Linux Foundation and its Contributors. Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported. All other rights are expressly reserved.\"\n\n\n1.8.3\n The official copyright notice to be used with any non-verbatim reproduction and/or distribution of this SPDX Specification, including without limitation any partial use or combining this SPDX Specification with another work, is:\n\n\n\"This is not an official SPDX Specification.

All other rights are expressly reserved by Linux Foundation and its Contributors.\"\n\n\n1.9 Differences from SPDX Specification 2.0 \n\n\n1.9.1\n Snippets have been added to allow a portion of a file to be identified as having different properties from the file it resides in. The use of snippets is completely optional and it is not manditory for snippets to be identified. See \nsection 5 Snippet Information\n for further details on the fields available to describe snippets.\n\n\n1.9.2\n External Packages can now be refered to in SPDX documents. When there is no SPDX file information available to document the content of these external packages, then the \nfilesAnalyzed\n attribute on a package should be set to false. See \nsection 3.8\n Files Analyzed for more information.\n\n\n1.9.3\n Packages are now able to associate with an \u201cExternal Reference\u201d which allows a Package to reference an external source of additional information, metadata, enumerations, asset identifiers, or downloadable content believed to be relevant to the Package. See: section \n3.21 External Reference\n, \n3.22 External Reference Comment\n and \nAppendix VI: External Repository Identifiers\n for more information.\n\n\n1.9.4\n The \u201cArtifact of Project\u201d fields at the file level are now deprecated, as they can be replaced by a relationship to the more descriptive External Packages.\n\n\n1.9.5\n A new appendix \u201cUsing SPDX short identifiers in Source Files\u201d has been added to document the best practices to refer to the licenses in the SPDX license list that have emerged from the development community. See \nAppendix V: Using SPDX short identifiers in Source Files\n for more information.\n\n\n1.9.6\n A new appendix \"SPDX Lite\" has been added to document a lightweight subset of the SPDX specification for scenarios where a full SPDX document is not required. See \nAppendix VIII\n for more information.\n\n\n1.9.7\n Miscellaneous bug fixes and non-breaking improvements as reported on the mailing list and reported as issues on the \nspdx-spec GitHub repository\n.",

It provides the necessary information for forward and backward compatibility for processing tools.\n\n\nCardinality: Mandatory, one.\n\n\nFields:\n\n\n2.1 SPDX Version \n\n\n2.1.1\n Purpose: Provide a reference number that can be used to understand how to parse and interpret the rest of the file. It will enable both future changes to the specification and to support backward compatibility. The version number consists of a major and minor version indicator. The major field will be incremented when incompatible changes between versions are made (one or more sections are created, modified or deleted). The minor field will be incremented when backwards compatible changes are made.\n\n\n2.1.2\n Intent: Here, parties exchanging information in accordance with SPDX specification need to provide 100% transparency as to which SPDX specification such information is conforming to.\n\n\n2.1.3\n Cardinality: Mandatory, one.\n\n\n2.1.4\n Data Format: \nSPDX-M.N\n where:\n\n\nM\n is major version number\n\n\nN\n is minor version number.\n\n\n2.1.5\n Tag: \nSPDXVersion:\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSPDXVersion: SPDX-2.2\n\n\n\n2.1.6\n RDF: \nspdx:specVersion\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n<SpdxDocument rdf:about=\"...\">\n   <specVersion>SPDX-2.2</specVersion>\n</SpdxDocument>\n\n\n\nThis specification uses the prefix \nrdf:\n to refer to the \nRDF/XML\n namespace:\n\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\n\n\n\n2.2 Data License \n\n\n2.2.1\n Purpose: Compliance with the SPDX specification includes populating the SPDX fields therein with data related to such fields (\"SPDX-Metadata\"). The SPDX specification contains numerous fields where an SPDX document creator may provide relevant explanatory text in SPDX-Metadata.\nWithout opining on the lawfulness of \"database rights\" (in jurisdictions where applicable), such explanatory text is copyrightable subject matter in most Berne Convention countries.\nBy using the SPDX specification, or any portion hereof, you hereby agree that any copyright rights (as determined by your jurisdiction) in any SPDX-Metadata, including without limitation explanatory text, shall be subject to the terms of the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license.  For SPDX-Metadata not containing any copyright rights, you hereby agree and acknowledge that the SPDX-Metadata is provided to you \"as-is\" and without any representations or warranties of any kind concerning the SPDX-Metadata, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n\n2.2.2\n Intent: This is to alleviate any concern that content (the data or database) in an SPDX file is subject to any form of intellectual property right that could restrict the re-use of the information or the creation of another SPDX file for the same project(s). This approach avoids intellectual property and related restrictions over the SPDX file, however individuals can still contract with each other to restrict release of specific collections of SPDX files (which map to software bill of materials) and the identification of the supplier of SPDX files.\n\n\n2.2.3\n Cardinality: Mandatory, one.\n\n\n2.2.4\n Data Format: \nCC0-1.0\n\n\n2.2.5\n Tag: \nDataLicense:\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nDataLicense: CC0-1.0\n\n\n\n2.2.6\n RDF: \nspdx:dataLicense\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n<SpdxDocument rdf:about=\"...\">\n  <dataLicense rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/CC0-1.0\" />\n</SpdxDocument>\n\n\n\n2.3 SPDX Identifier \n\n\n2.3.1\n Purpose: Identify the current SPDX document which may be referenced in relationships by other files, packages internally and documents externally.

See \nsection 2.6\n for a description on how external documents are referenced. Although it is not required, the URI can be constructed in a way which provides information on how the SPDX document can be found. For example, the URI can be a URL referencing the SPDX document itself, if it is available on the internet. A best practice for creating the URI for SPDX documents available on the public internet is \nhttp://[CreatorWebsite]/[pathToSpdx]/[DocumentName]-[UUID]\n where:\n\n\n\n\nCreatorWebsite\n is a website hosted by the creator of the document. (e.g. an SPDX document provided by SPDX would be spdx.org)\n\n\nPathToSpdx\n is a path to where SPDX documents are stored on the website (e.g. /spdx/spdxdocs)\n\n\nDocumentName\n is a name given to the SPDX Document itself, typically the (set of) package name(s) followed by the version. \n(see section 2.4)\n.\n\n\nUUID\n is a \nuniversally unique identifier\n. The UUID could be a version 4 random UUID which can be generated from the \nOnline UUID Generator\n or a version 5 UUID generated from a sha1 checksum known to be unique for this specific SPDX document version.\n\n\nIf the creator does not own their own website, a default SPDX CreatorWebsite and PathToSpdx can be used \nspdx.org/spdxdocs\n. Note that the SPDX documents are not currently stored or accessible on this website. The URI is only used to create a unique ID following the above conventions.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the URI does not have to be accessible. It is only intended to provide a unique ID. In many cases, the URI will point to a web accessible document, but this should not be assumed to be the case.\n\n\n2.5.3\n Cardinality: Mandatory, one.\n\n\n2.5.4\n Data Format: unique absolute Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as specified in \nRFC-3986\n, with the following exceptions:\n\n\nThe SPDX Document URI cannot contain a URI \"part\" (e.g. the \n#\n delimiter), since the \n#\n is used to uniquely identify SPDX element identifiers.\nThe URI must contain a scheme (e.g. \nhttps:\n).\n\n\nThe URI must be unique for the SPDX document including the specific version of the SPDX document. If the SPDX document is updated, thereby creating a new version, a new URI for the updated document must be used.

This may include the packaging and compression methods used as part of the file name, if appropriate.\n\n\n3.4.2\n Intent: The actual file name of the compressed file containing the package may be a significant technical element that needs to be included with each package identification information. If a grouping, like a set of files in a subdirectory, is being treated as a package, the subdirectory name may be appropriate to provide. Subdirectory name is preceeded with a \n./\n.

This may or may not be different from the originating distribution source for the package. The name of the Package Supplier must be an organization or recognized author and not a web site. For example, \nSourceForge\n is a host website, not a supplier, the supplier for https://sourceforge.net/projects/bridge/ is \u201c\nThe Linux Foundation\n.\u201d\n\n\nUse \nNOASSERTION\n if:\n\n\n(i) the SPDX file creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination;\n\n\n(ii) the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or\n\n\n(iii) the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).\n\n\n3.5.2\n Intent: Assist with understanding the point of distribution for the code in the package. This field is vital for ensuring that downstream package recipients can address any ambiguity or concerns that might arise with the information in the SPDX file or the contents of the package it documents.\n\n\n3.5.3\n Cardinality: Optional, one.\n\n\n3.5.4\n Data Format: Single line of text with the following keywords | \nNOASSERTION\n\n\n\n\nPerson:\n person name and optional \n(<email>)\n\n\nOrganization:\n organization name and optional \n(<email>)\n\n\n\n\n3.5.5\n Tag: \nPackageSupplier:\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nPackageSupplier: Person: Jane Doe (jane.doe@example.com)\n\n\n\n3.5.6\n RDF: property \nspdx:supplier\n in class \nspdx:Package\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n<Package rdf:about=\"...\">\n    ...\n    <supplier>Person: Jane Doe (jane.doe@example.com)</supplier>\n    ...\n</Package>\n\n\n\n3.6 Package Originator \n\n\n3.6.1\n Purpose: If the package identified in the SPDX file originated from a different person or organization than identified as Package Supplier (see \nsection 3.5\n above), this field identifies from where or whom the package originally came. In some cases a package may be created and originally distributed by a different third party than the Package Supplier of the package. For example, the SPDX file identifies the package \nglibc\n and \nRed Hat\n[RedHat] as the Package Supplier, but the \nFree Software Foundation\n is the Package Originator.\n\n\nUse \nNOASSERTION\n if:\n\n\n(i) the SPDX file creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination;\n\n\n(ii) the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or\n\n\n(iii) the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).\n\n\n3.6.2\n Intent: Assist with understanding the point of origin of the code in the package. This field is vital for understanding who originally distributed a package and should help in addressing any ambiguity or concerns that might arise with the information in the SPDX file or the contents of the Package it documents.\n\n\n3.6.3\n Cardinality: Optional, one.\n\n\n3.6.4\n Data Format: Single line of text with the following keywords | \nNOASSERTION\n\n\n\n\nPerson:\n person name and optional \n(<email>)\n\n\nOrganization:\n organization name and optional \n(<email>)\n\n\n\n\n3.6.5\n Tag: \nPackageOriginator:\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nPackageOriginator: Organization: ExampleCodeInspect (contact@example.com)\n\n\n\n3.6.6\n RDF: property \nspdx:originator\n in class \nspdx:Package\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n<Package rdf:about=\"...\">\n    <originator>Organization: ExampleCodeInspect (contact@example.com)</originator>\n</Package>\n\n\n\n3.7 Package Download Location \n\n\n3.7.1\n Purpose: This section identifies the download Universal Resource Locator (URL), or a specific location within a version control system (VCS) for the package at the time that the SPDX file was created.\n\n\nUse:\n\n\n\n\nNONE\n if there is no download location whatsoever.\n\n\n\n\nNOASSERTION\n if:\n\n\n(i) the SPDX file creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination;\n\n\n(ii) the SPDX file creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or\n\n\n(iii) the SPDX file creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.2\n Intent: Where and how to download the exact package being referenced is critical verification and tracking data.\n\n\n3.7.3\n Cardinality: Mandatory, one.\n\n\n3.7.4\n Data Format: uniform resource locator | VCS location | \nNONE\n | \nNOASSERTION\n\n\nFor version-controlled files, the VCS location syntax is similar to a URL and has the:\n\n\n<vcs_tool>+<transport>://<host_name>[/<path_to_repository>][@<revision_tag_or_branch>][#<sub_path>]\n\n\n\nThis VCS location compact notation (inspired and mostly adopted from \npip\n as of 2015-02-20) supports referencing locations in version control systems such as \nGit\n, \nMercurial\n, \nSubversion\n and \nBazaar\n, and specifies the type of VCS tool using url prefixes: \ngit+\n, \nhg+\n, \nbzr+\n, \nsvn+\n and specific transport schemes such as SSH or HTTPS.\n\n\nSpecifying sub-paths, branch names, a commit hash, a revision or a tag name is recommended, and supported using the \n@\n delimiter for commits and the \n#\n delimiter for sub-paths.\n\n\nUsing user names and password in the \n<host_name>\n is not supported and should be considered as an error.

If \nfalse\n, indicates packages that represent metadata or URI references to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component. If \nfalse\n, the package must not contain any files.\n\n\n3.8.2\n Intent: A package can refer to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component that is external to the SPDX document.\n\n\nSome examples:\n\n\nA bundle of external products: Package A can be metadata about Packages and their dependencies. It may also be a loosely organized manifest of references to Packages involved in a product or project. Build or execution may transitively discover more Packages and dependencies. All of these referenced Packages can have their own SPDX Documents. In this case, Package A may be defined with its File Analyzed attribute set to \nfalse\n. Package A includes External Document References to SPDX documents containing Packages referenced in all the available relationships. The Relationships section then relates the SPDX documents and contained SPDX elements with appropriate semantics per the dependencies in the scope of Package A.\nPackage relation to external product: Package A can have a STATIC_LINK relationship to Package B, but the binary representation of Package B is furnished by the build process and thus not contained in the file list of Package A. In this case, Package B needs to be defined with its Files Analyzed attribute set to false and all the other attributes subject to the subsequently defined constraints. Then, the relationship between Package A and Package B can be documented as described in \nSection 7\n.\nFile derived from external product: Package A contains multiple files derived from an outside project. Rather than use the \nartifactOf*\n attributes (Sections 4.9-4.11) to describe the relation of these files to their project, the outside project can be represented by another package, Package B, whose \nFilesAnalyzed\n attribute is set to \nfalse\n. Each of the binary files can then have a relationship to package B (Section 6). This allows the outside project to be represented by a single SPDX identifier (the identifier of Package B). It also allows the relationship(s) between the outside project and each of the files be represented in much more detail.\n\n\n3.8.3\n Cardinality: Optional, one.  If omitted, the default value of \ntrue\n is assumed.\n\n\n3.8.4\n Data Format: Boolean\n\n\n3.8.5\n Tag: \nFilesAnalyzed\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nFilesAnalyzed: false\n\n\n\n3.8.6\n RDF: property \nspdx:filesAnalyzed\n in class \nspdx:Package\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n<Package rdf:about=\"...\">\n    ...\n    <filesAnalyzed>false</filesAnalyzed>\n    ...\n</Package>\n\n\n\n3.9 Package Verification Code \n\n\n3.9.1\n Purpose: This field provides an independently reproducible mechanism identifying specific contents of a package based on the actual files (except the SPDX file itself, if it is included in the package) that make up each package and that correlates to the data in this SPDX file. This identifier enables a recipient to determine if any file in the original package (that the analysis was done on) has been changed and permits inclusion of an SPDX file as part of a package.\n\n\n3.9.2\n Intent: Provide a unique identifier based on the files inside each package, eliminating confusion over which version or modification of a specific package the SPDX file refers to.

If  false , indicates packages that represent metadata or URI references to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component. If  false , the package must not contain any files.  3.8.2  Intent: A package can refer to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component that is external to the SPDX document.  Some examples:  A bundle of external products: Package A can be metadata about Packages and their dependencies. It may also be a loosely organized manifest of references to Packages involved in a product or project. Build or execution may transitively discover more Packages and dependencies. All of these referenced Packages can have their own SPDX Documents. In this case, Package A may be defined with its File Analyzed attribute set to  false . Package A includes External Document References to SPDX documents containing Packages referenced in all the available relationships. The Relationships section then relates the SPDX documents and contained SPDX elements with appropriate semantics per the dependencies in the scope of Package A.\nPackage relation to external product: Package A can have a STATIC_LINK relationship to Package B, but the binary representation of Package B is furnished by the build process and thus not contained in the file list of Package A. In this case, Package B needs to be defined with its Files Analyzed attribute set to false and all the other attributes subject to the subsequently defined constraints. Then, the relationship between Package A and Package B can be documented as described in  Section 7 .\nFile derived from external product: Package A contains multiple files derived from an outside project. Rather than use the  artifactOf*  attributes (Sections 4.9-4.11) to describe the relation of these files to their project, the outside project can be represented by another package, Package B, whose  FilesAnalyzed  attribute is set to  false . Each of the binary files can then have a relationship to package B (Section 6). This allows the outside project to be represented by a single SPDX identifier (the identifier of Package B). It also allows the relationship(s) between the outside project and each of the files be represented in much more detail.  3.8.3  Cardinality: Optional, one.

It provides important meta information about a given file including licenses and copyright. Starting with SPDX 2.0, it is not necessary to have a package wrapping a set of files.\n\n\nWhen implementing \ntag:value\n format, the positioning of File elements is syntactically significant:\n\n\nFiles are assumed to be associated with the Package Information that immediately precedes it, if a package exists.\nPresence of a new Package Information signals the end of the set of files associated with the preceding package, unless an explicit Relationship is used.\nIf a package contains files, the File Information section must follow its Package Information section.\nIf a File is not part of any package, it must precede any Package Information section reference in the SPDX document.\nThe first field to start off the description of a File must be the File Name in \ntag:value\n format.\nFile information is associated with the File Name that precedes it.\nAnnotations on the file and Relationships from the file may appear after the file information, before the next file or Package Information section.\n\n\nWhen implementing file information in RDF, the \nspdx:hasFile\n property is used to associate the package with the file.\n\n\n4.1 File Name \n\n\n4.1.1\n Purpose: Identify the full path and filename that corresponds to the file information in this section.\n\n\n4.1.2\n Intent: To aid finding the correct file which corresponds to the file information.\n\n\n4.1.3\n Cardinality: Mandatory, one.\n\n\n4.1.4\n Data Format: A relative filename with the root of the package archive or directory.\n\n\nIn general, every filename is preceded with a \n./\n, see \nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt\n for syntax.\n\n\n4.1.5\n Tag: \nFileName:\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nFileName: ./package/foo.c\n\n\n\n4.1.6\n RDF: Property \nspdx:fileName\n in class \nspdx:File\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n<File rdf:about=\"...\">\n    <fileName>./package/foo.c</fileName>\n    ...\n</File>\n\n\n\n4.2 File SPDX Identifier \n\n\n4.2.1\n Purpose: Uniquely identify any element in an SPDX document which may be referenced by other elements. These may be referenced internally and externally with the addition of the SPDX Document Identifier.\n\n\n4.2.2\n Intent: There may be several versions of the same file within an SPDX document.

The RDF must also contain an algorithm identifier and a checksum value. For example, when the algorithm identifier is SHA1, the checksum value should be a 160 bit value represented as 40 lowercase hexadecimal digits.

The purpose of the SPDX License List is to enable easy and efficient identification of such licenses and exceptions in an SPDX document (or elsewhere). The SPDX License List includes a standardized short identifier, full name for each license, vetted license text, other basic information, and a canonical permanent URL for each license and exception. By providing a short identifier, users can efficiently refer to a license without having to redundantly reproduce the full license. License exceptions can be used with the License Expression Syntax operator, \"WITH\" to create a license with an exception.\n\n\n\n\nLicense Exceptions\n: The list of commonly found exceptions to open source licenses, which can be used with the License Expression operator, \"WITH\" to create a license with an exception.\n\n\nMaster Files\n: The HTML pages you see here are generated from the master files for the SPDX License List. The master files include a spreadsheet listing all the licenses, deprecated licenses, and license exceptions; and the text for each license in a .txt file. These files are available in a Git repository.\n\n\nOverview: For general information about the SPDX License List, including principles for inclusion of a license and an explanation of the fields contained on the list.\n\n\nMatching Guidelines\n: Guidelines for what constitutes a license match to the SPDX License List. For licenses that include markup, the license text on the HTML pages here will display omitable text in blue and replaceable text in red (see Guideline #2 for more information).\n\n\nRequest New License\n: For instructions on how to propose additional licenses or license exceptions be added to the SPDX License List.\n\n\n\n\nThe following table contains the full names and short identifiers for the SPDX License List, v3.7 which was released 2019-10-22.

            "text": "The SPDX License List is a list of commonly found licenses and exceptions used for open source and other collaborative software. The purpose of the SPDX License List is to enable easy and efficient identification of such licenses and exceptions in an SPDX document (or elsewhere). The SPDX License List includes a standardized short identifier, full name for each license, vetted license text, other basic information, and a canonical permanent URL for each license and exception. By providing a short identifier, users can efficiently refer to a license without having to redundantly reproduce the full license. License exceptions can be used with the License Expression Syntax operator, \"WITH\" to create a license with an exception.   License Exceptions : The list of commonly found exceptions to open source licenses, which can be used with the License Expression operator, \"WITH\" to create a license with an exception.  Master Files : The HTML pages you see here are generated from the master files for the SPDX License List. The master files include a spreadsheet listing all the licenses, deprecated licenses, and license exceptions; and the text for each license in a .txt file. These files are available in a Git repository.  Overview: For general information about the SPDX License List, including principles for inclusion of a license and an explanation of the fields contained on the list.  Matching Guidelines : Guidelines for what constitutes a license match to the SPDX License List. For licenses that include markup, the license text on the HTML pages here will display omitable text in blue and replaceable text in red (see Guideline #2 for more information).

            "text": "Appendix II: License Matching Guidelines and Templates\n\n\nThe \nSPDX License List Matching Guidelines\n provide guidelines to be used for the purposes of matching licenses and license exceptions against those included on the SPDX License List. There is no intent here to make a judgment or interpretation, but merely to ensure that when one SPDX user identifies a license as \"BSD-3-Clause,\" for example, it is indeed the same license as what someone else identifies as \"BSD-3-Clause\" and the same license as what is listed on the SPDX License List. Examples of how to apply some of the matching guidelines to a license or exception are provided via templates.  Templates are comprised of technical markup within the master license text file to provide further or specific guidance to SPDX document creators or tool makers.  Not all licenses or exceptions will have templates.\n\n\nSPDX License List Matching Guidelines, v2.0\n\n\n1 How These Guidelines Are Applied\n\n\n1.1 Purpose\n\n\nTo ensure consistent results by different SPDX document creators when matching license information that will be included in the License Information in File field. SPDX document creators or tools may match on the license or exception text itself, the official license header, or the SPDX License List short identifier.\n\n\n1.1.1 Guideline: Official License Headers\n\n\nThe same matching guidelines used for license and exception text apply to the official license headers. Where applicable, an official license header template file with markup is included with the SPDX License List. Official license headers are defined by the SPDX License List as specific text specified within the license itself to be put in the header of files. (see https://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/license-list-overview for more info).\n\n\n2 Substantive Text\n\n\n2.1 Purpose\n\n\nTo ensure that when matching licenses and exceptions to the SPDX License List, there is an appropriate balance between matching against the substantive text and disregarding parts of the text that do not alter the substantive text. Further guidelines of what can be disregarded or considered replaceable for purposes of matching are listed below here and in the subsequent specific guidelines. A conservative approach is taken in regards to rules about disregarded or replaceable text.\n\n\n2.1.1 Guideline: Verbatim Text\n\n\nLicense and exception text should be the same verbatim text (except for the guidelines stated here). The text should be in the same order, e.g., differently ordered paragraphs would not be considered a match.\n\n\n2.1.2 Guideline: No Additional Text\n\n\nMatched text should only include that found in the vetted license or exception text. Where a license or exception found includes additional text or clauses, this should not be considered a match.\n\n\n2.1.3 Guideline: Replaceable Text\n\n\nSome licenses include text that refers to the specific copyright holder or author, yet the rest of the license is exactly the same as a generic version. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of a specific name in one part of the license resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match (e.g., the third clause and disclaimer in the BSD licenses, or the third, fourth, and fifth clauses of Apache-1.1). In these cases, there should be a positive license match.\n\n\nText that can be considered replaceable for matching purposes is indicated in the SPDX License List template with mark-up and in the corresponding HTML pages with colored text. The text indicated as such can be replaced with similar values (e.g., a different name or generic term; different date) and still be considered a positive match. This rule also applies to text-matching in official license headers (see Guideline #1).\n\n\n2.1.4 Guideline: Omitable Text\n\n\nSome licenses have text that can simply be ignored. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of certain text that is superfluous or irrelevant in regards to the substantive license text resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match (e.g., directions on how to apply the license or other similar non-substantive exhibits). In these cases, there should be a positive license match.\n\n\nText that can be considered omitable for matching purposes is indicated in the SPDX License List template with mark-up and in the corresponding HTML pages with colored text. The license should be considered a match if the text indicated is present and matches OR the text indicated is missing altogether.\n\n\n3 Whitespace\n\n\n3.1 Purpose\n\n\nTo avoid the possibility of a non-match due to different spacing of words, line breaks, or paragraphs.\n\n\n3.1.1 Guideline\n\n\nAll whitespace should be treated as a single blank space. Templates do not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\n4 Capitalization\n\n\n4.1 Purpose\n\n\nTo avoid the possibility of a non-match due to lower case or upper case letters in otherwise the same words.\n\n\n4.1.1 Guideline\n\n\nAll upper case and lower case letters should be treated as lower case letters. Templates do not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\n5 Punctuation\n\n\n5.1 Purpose\n\n\nBecause punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence, punctuation needs to be included in the matching process. License template files do not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\n5.1.1 Guideline: Punctuation\n\n\nPunctuation should be matched, unless otherwise stated in these guidelines.\n\n\n5.1.2 Guideline: Hyphens, Dashes\n\n\nAny hyphen, dash, en dash, em dash, or other variation should be considered equivalent.\n\n\n5.1.3 Guideline: Quotes\n\n\nAny variation of quotations (single, double, curly, etc.) should be considered equivalent.\n\n\n6 Code Comment Indicators\n\n\n6.1 Purpose\n\n\nTo avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the existence or absence of code comment indicators placed within the license text, e.g. at the start of each line of text.\n\n\n6.1.1 Guideline\n\n\nAny kind of code comment indicator or prefix which occurs at the beginning of each line in a matchable section should be ignored for matching purposes. Templates do not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\n7 Bullets and Numbering\n\n\n7.1 Purpose\n\n\nTo avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the otherwise same license using bullets instead of numbers, number instead of letter, or no bullets instead of bullet, etc., for a list of clauses.\n\n\n7.1.1 Guideline\n\n\nWhere a line starts with a bullet, number, letter, or some form of a list item (determined where list item is followed by a space, then the text of the sentence), ignore the list item for matching purposes. Templates do not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\n8 Varietal Word Spelling\n\n\n8.1 Purpose\n\n\nEnglish uses different spelling for some words. By identifying the spelling variations for words found or likely to be found in licenses, we avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the same word being spelled differently. This list is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all spelling variations, but meant to capture the words most likely to be found in open source software licenses.\n\n\n8.1.1 Guideline\n\n\nThe words in the following columns are considered equivalent and interchangeable. Templates do not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1\n\n\nColumn 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Acknowledgement\n\n\n1. Acknowledgment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Analog\n\n\n2.

Copyright owner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Copyright Symbol\n\n\n9.1 Purpose\n\n\nBy having a rule regarding the use of \"\u00a9\", \"(c)\", or \"copyright\", we avoid the possibility of a mismatch based on these variations.\n\n\n9.1.1 Guideline\n\n\n\"\u00a9\", \"(c)\", or \"Copyright\" should be considered equivalent and interchangeable. Templates do not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\n10 Copyright Notice\n\n\n10.1 Purpose\n\n\nTo avoid a license mismatch merely because the copyright notice (usually found above the actual license or exception text) is different. The copyright notice is important information to be recorded elsewhere in the SPDX file, but for the purposes of matching a license to the SPDX License List, it should be ignored because it is not part of the substantive license text.\n\n\n10.1.1 Guideline\n\n\nIgnore copyright notices. A copyright notice consists of the following elements, for example: \"2012 Copyright, John Doe. All rights reserved.\" or \"(c) 2012 John Doe.\" Templates may or may not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\n11 License Name or Title\n\n\n11.1 Purpose\n\n\nTo avoid a license mismatch merely because the name or title of the license is different than how the license is usually referred to or different than the SPDX full name. This also avoids a mismatch if the title or name of the license is simply not included.\n\n\n11.1.1 Guideline\n\n\nIgnore the license name or title for matching purposes, so long as what ignored is the title only and there is no additional substantive text added here. Templates do not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\n12 Extraneous Text At the End of a License\n\n\n12.1 Purpose\n\n\nTo avoid a license mismatch merely because extraneous text that appears at the end of the terms of a license is different or missing. This also avoids a mismatch if the extraneous text merely serves as a license notice example and includes a specific copyright holder's name.\n\n\n12.1.1 Guideline\n\n\nIgnore any text that occurs after the obvious end of the license and does not include substantive text of the license, for example: text that occurs after a statement such as, \"END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS,\" or an exhibit or appendix that includes an example or instructions on to how to apply the license to your code. Do not apply this guideline or ignore text that is comprised of additional license terms (e.g., permitted additional terms under GPL-3.0, section 7). Templates do not include markup for this guideline.\n\n\nSPDX License List Template Access\n\n\nThe master files for the SPDX License List includes a spreadsheet listing all the licenses, deprecated licenses, and license exceptions; and the text for each license in a .txt file. These files are available in a \nGit repository\n. Text that can be considered replaceable or omitable for matching purposes is indicated in the .txt file with markup as per the description below.\n\n\nRDFa Access: The template text for the license can be accessed using the RDF tag licenseTemplate on the web page containing the license.\n\n\nTemplate Format\n\n\nA template is composed of text with zero or more rules embedded in it.\n\n\nA rule is a variable section of a license wrapped between double angle brackets \u201c<<>>\u201d and is composed of 4 fields. Each field is separated with a semi-colon \u201c;\u201d. Rules cannot be embedded within other rules. Rule fields begin with a case sensitive tag followed by an equal sign \u201c=\u201d.\n\n\nRule fields:\n\n\n\n\ntype: indicates whether the text is replaceable or omitable as per \nMatching Guideline #2\n (\u201cSubstantive Text\u201d).\n\n\nIndicated by <\n> or...\n\n\nIndicated by <\n> and <\n> respectively.\n\n\nThis field is the first field and is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname: name of the field in the template.\n\n\nThis field is unique within each license template.\n\n\nThis field is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noriginal: the original text of the rule.\n\n\nThis field is required for a rule type: <\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatch: a \nPOSIX extended regular expession (ERE)\n.\n\n\nThis field is required for a rule type: <\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nPOSIX ERE\n in the match field has the following restrictions and extensions:\n\n\n    Semicolons are escaped with \\;\n\n    POSIX Bracket Extensions are not allowed\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n<<var;name=organizationClause3;original=the copyright holder;match=.+>>",

            "text": "SPDX License Expressions\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOften a single license can be used to represent the licensing terms of a source code or binary file, but there are situations where a single license identifier is not sufficient. A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-3-Clause).\n\n\nSPDX License Expressions provides a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef-\n[idString]\n; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g., \nAND\n, \nOR\n, \nWITH\n and \n+\n). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid an SPDX License Expression in this section.\n\n\nThe exact syntax of license expressions is described below in \nABNF\n.\n\n\nidstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" )\n\n\nlicense-id = \\\nAppendix I.1\n>\n\n\nlicense-exception-id = \\\nAppendix I.2\n>\n\n\nlicense-ref = [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring)\n\n\nsimple-expression = license-id / license-id\"+\" / license-ref\n\n\ncompound-expression = 1*1(simple-expression /\n\n\nsimple-expression \"WITH\" license-exception-id /\n\n\ncompound-expression \"AND\" compound-expression /\n\n\ncompound-expression \"OR\" compound-expression ) /\n\n\n\"(\" compound-expression \")\" )\n\n\nlicense-expression = 1*1(simple-expression / compound-expression)\n\n\nIn the following sections we describe in more detail \n<license-expression>\n construct, a licensing expression string that enables a more accurate representation of the licensing terms of modern day software.\n\n\nA valid \n<license-expression>\n string consists of either:\n\n\n(i) a simple license expression, such as a single license identifier; or\n\n\n(ii) a more complex expression constructed by combining smaller valid expressions using Boolean license operators.\n\n\nThere MUST NOT be whitespace between a license-id and any following \n+\n. This supports easy parsing and backwards compatibility. There MUST be whitespace on either side of the operator \"WITH\". There MUST be whitespace and/or parentheses on either side of the operators \nAND\n and \nOR\n.\n\n\nSimple License Expressions \n\n\nA simple \n<license-expression>\n is composed one of the following:\n\n\n\n\nAn SPDX License List Short Form Identifier. For example: GPL-2.0-only\n\n\nAn SPDX License List Short Form Identifier with a unary \"+\" operator suffix to represent the current version of the license or any later version. For example: GPL-2.0+\n\n\nA SPDX user defined license reference: [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring)\n\n\n\n\nSome examples:\n\n\nLicenseRef-23\n\nLicenseRef-MIT-Style-1\n\nDocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2:LicenseRef-MIT-Style-2\n\n\n\nComposite License Expressions \n\n\nMore expressive composite license expressions can be constructed using \"OR\", \"AND\", and \"WITH\" operators similar to constructing mathematical expressions using arithmetic operators. For the \ntag:value\n format, any license expression that consists of more than one license identifier and/or LicenseRef, should be encapsulated by parentheses: \"( )\". This has been specified to facilitate expression parsing. Nested parentheses can also be used to specify an order of precedence which is discussed in more detail in subsection (4).\n\n\n1) Disjunctive \"OR\" Operator\n\n\nIf presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new lincense expression, where both the left and right operands are valid license expression values.\n\n\nFor example, when given a choice between the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be:\n\n\n(LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT)\n\n\n\nAn example representing a choice between three different licenses would be:\n\n\n(LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT OR BSD-3-Clause)\n\n\n2) Conjunctive \"AND\" Operator\n\n\nIf required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are a valid license expression values.\n\n\nFor example, when one is required to comply with both the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be:\n\n\n(LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT)\n\n\n\nAn example where all three different licenses apply would be:\n\n\n(LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause)\n\n\n\n3) Exception \"WITH\" Operator\n\n\nSometimes a set of license terms apply except under special circumstances. In this case, use the binary \"WITH\" operator to construct a new license expression to represent the special exception situation. A valid \n<license-expression>\n is where the left operand is a \n<simple-expression>\n value and the right operand is a \n<license-exception-id>\n that represents the special exception terms.\n\n\nFor example, when the Bison exception is to be applied to GPL-2.0-or-later, the expression would be:\n\n\n(GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2)\n\n\n\nThe current set of valid exceptions can be found in \nAppendix I, section 2\n. For the most up to date set of exceptions please see \nspdx.org/licenses\n. If the applicable exception is not found on the SPDX License Exception List, then use a single \n<license-ref>\n to represent the entire license terms (including the exception).\n\n\n4) Order of Precedence and Parentheses\n\n\nThe order of application of the operators in an expression matters (similar to mathematical operators). The default operator order of precedence of a \n<license-expression>\n a is:\n\n\n+\nWITH\nAND\nOR\n\n\n\nwhere a lower order operator is applied before a higher order operator.\n\n\nFor example, the following expression:\n\n\nLGPL-2.1-only OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT\n\n\n\nrepresents a license choice between either LGPL-2.1-only and the expression BSD-3-Clause AND MIT because the AND operator takes precedence over (is applied before) the OR operator.\n\n\nWhen required to express an order of precedence that is different from the default order a \n<license-expression>\n can be encapsulated in pairs of parentheses: ( ), to indicate that the operators found inside the parentheses takes precedence over operators outside. This is also similar to the use of parentheses in an algebraic expression e.g., (5+7)/2.\n\n\nFor instance, the following expression:\n\n\n(MIT AND (LGPL-2.1-or-later OR BSD-3-Clause))\n\n\n\nstates the OR operator should be applied before the AND operator. That is, one should first select between the LGPL-2.1-or-later or the BSD-3-Clause license before applying the MIT license.\n\n\n5) License Expressions in RDF \n\n\nA conjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a \n<spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet>\n element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the conjunctive license. Two or more members are required.\n\n\n<spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet>\n    <spdx:member rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only\"/>\n    <spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about=\"http://example.org#LicenseRef-EternalSurrender\">\n        <spdx:extractedText>\n            In exchange for using this software, you agree to give its author all your worldly possessions.\n            You will not hold the author liable for all the damage this software will inevitably cause not only\n            to your person and property, but to the entire fabric of the cosmos.\n        </spdx:extractedText>\n        <spdx:licenseId>LicenseRef-EternalSurrender</spdx:licenseId>\n    </spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo>\n</spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet>\n\n\n\nA disjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a \n<spdx:DisjunctiveLicenseSet>\n element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the disjunctive license.

            "text": "Often a single license can be used to represent the licensing terms of a source code or binary file, but there are situations where a single license identifier is not sufficient. A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-3-Clause).  SPDX License Expressions provides a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef- [idString] ; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g.,  AND ,  OR ,  WITH  and  + ). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid an SPDX License Expression in this section.  The exact syntax of license expressions is described below in  ABNF .  idstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" )  license-id = \\ Appendix I.1 >  license-exception-id = \\ Appendix I.2 >  license-ref = [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring)  simple-expression = license-id / license-id\"+\" / license-ref  compound-expression = 1*1(simple-expression /  simple-expression \"WITH\" license-exception-id /  compound-expression \"AND\" compound-expression /  compound-expression \"OR\" compound-expression ) /  \"(\" compound-expression \")\" )  license-expression = 1*1(simple-expression / compound-expression)  In the following sections we describe in more detail  <license-expression>  construct, a licensing expression string that enables a more accurate representation of the licensing terms of modern day software.  A valid  <license-expression>  string consists of either:  (i) a simple license expression, such as a single license identifier; or  (ii) a more complex expression constructed by combining smaller valid expressions using Boolean license operators.  There MUST NOT be whitespace between a license-id and any following  + . This supports easy parsing and backwards compatibility. There MUST be whitespace on either side of the operator \"WITH\". There MUST be whitespace and/or parentheses on either side of the operators  AND  and  OR .",

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\na. \n\"Adaptation\"\n means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n\n\nb. \n\"Collection\"\n means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n\n\nc. \n\"Distribute\"\n means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n\nd. \n\"Licensor\"\n means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n\n\ne. \n\"Original Author\"\n means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n\nf. \n\"Work\"\n means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n\ng. \n\"You\"\n means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n\nh. \n\"Publicly Perform\"\n means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n\ni. \n\"Reproduce\"\n means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair Dealing Rights\n. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense Grant\n. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n\nb. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n\n\nc. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n\nd. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\n\ne. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n\ni. \nNon-waivable Compulsory License Schemes\n. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n\n\nii. \nWaivable Compulsory License Schemes\n. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n\n\niii. \nVoluntary License Schemes\n. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n\n\n\nRestrictions\n. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n\n\n\na. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n\nb. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n\nc. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nRepresentations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitation on Liability\n. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\n\n\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n\nb. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n\nc. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n\nd. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n\ne. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n\nf.

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.  BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.   Definitions   a.  \"Adaptation\"  means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.  b.  \"Collection\"  means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.  c.  \"Distribute\"  means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.  d.  \"Licensor\"  means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.  e.  \"Original Author\"  means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.  f.  \"Work\"  means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.  g.  \"You\"  means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.  h.  \"Publicly Perform\"  means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.  i.  \"Reproduce\"  means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.    Fair Dealing Rights . Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.    License Grant . Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.  e. For the avoidance of doubt:  i.  Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;  ii.  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,  iii.  Voluntary License Schemes . The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.  The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.   Restrictions . The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.   Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.    Limitation on Liability . EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    Termination    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.   Miscellaneous   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.",
