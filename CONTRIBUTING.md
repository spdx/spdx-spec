# Contributing

The SPDX specification is maintained by the SPDX [legal][spdx-legal] and [tech][spdx-tech] teams.
Design and planning is primarily done via the team [mailing][spdx-legal-list] [lists][spdx-tech-list] and meetings.
You may want to discuss significant changes on the mailing list first to get design feedback before investing time in a pull request.
Minor changes such as markup and typo fixes may be submitted directly to this repository (either as [issues][] or [pull-requests][]) without previous discussion.
