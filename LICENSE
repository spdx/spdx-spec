Community Specification License 1.0

The Purpose of this License. This License sets forth the terms under which 1) Contributor will participate in and contribute to the development of specifications, standards, best practices, guidelines, and other similar materials under this Working Group, and 2) how the materials developed under this License may be used.  It is not intended for source code.  Capitalized terms are defined in the License's last section.

1. Copyright.

1.1. Copyright License. Contributor grants everyone a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this License) copyright license, without any obligation for accounting, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute any materials it submits to the full extent of its copyright interest in those materials. Contributor also acknowledges that the Working Group may exercise copyright rights in the Specification, including the rights to submit the Specification to another standards organization.

1.2. Copyright Attribution. As a condition, anyone exercising this copyright license must include attribution to the Working Group in any derivative work based on materials developed by the Working Group.  That attribution must include, at minimum, the material's name, version number, and source from where the materials were retrieved.  Attribution is not required for implementations of the Specification.

2. Patents.

2.1. Patent License.

2.1.1. As a Result of Contributions.

2.1.1.1. As a Result of Contributions to Draft Specifications. Contributor grants Licensee a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this License) license to its Necessary Claims in 1) Contributor's Contributions and 2) to the Draft Specification that is within Scope as of the date of that Contribution, in both cases for Licensee's Implementation of the Draft Specification, except for those patent claims excluded by Contributor under Section 3.

2.1.1.2. For Approved Specifications. Contributor grants Licensee a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this License) license to its Necessary Claims included the Approved Specification that are within Scope for Licensee's Implementation of the Approved Specification, except for those patent claims excluded by Contributor under Section 3.

2.1.2. Patent Grant from Licensee. Licensee grants each other Licensee a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this License) license to its Necessary Claims for its Implementation, except for those patent claims excluded under Section 3.

2.1.3. Licensee Acceptance. The patent grants set forth in Section 2.1 extend only to Licensees that have indicated their agreement to this License as follows:

2.1.3.1. Source Code Distributions. For distribution in source code, by including this License in the root directory of the source code with the Implementation;

2.1.3.2. Non-Source Code Distributions. For distribution in any form other than source code, by including this License in the documentation, legal notices, via notice in the software, and/or other written materials provided with the Implementation; or

2.1.3.3. Via Notices.md. By issuing pull request or commit to the Specification's repository's Notices.md file by the Implementer's authorized representative, including the Implementer's name, authorized individual and system identifier, and Specification version.

2.1.4. Defensive Termination. If any Licensee files or maintains a claim in a court asserting that a Necessary Claim is infringed by an Implementation, any licenses granted under this License to the Licensee are immediately terminated unless 1) that claim is directly in response to a claim against Licensee regarding an Implementation, or 2) that claim was brought to enforce the terms of this License, including intervention in a third-party action by a Licensee.

2.1.5. Additional Conditions. This License is not an assurance (i) that any of Contributor's copyrights or issued patent claims cover an Implementation of the Specification or are enforceable or (ii) that an Implementation of the Specification would not infringe intellectual property rights of any third party.

2.2. Patent Licensing Commitment. In addition to the rights granted in Section 2.1, Contributor agrees to grant everyone a no charge, royalty-free license on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to Contributor's Necessary Claims that are within Scope for:
1) Implementations of a Draft Specification, where such license applies only to those Necessary Claims infringed by implementing Contributor's Contribution(s) included in that Draft Specification, and
2) Implementations of the Approved Specification.

This patent licensing commitment does not apply to those claims subject to Contributor's Exclusion Notice under Section 3.

2.3. Effect of Withdrawal. Contributor may withdraw from the Working Group by issuing a pull request or commit providing notice of withdrawal to the Working Group repository's Notices.md file.  All of Contributor's existing commitments and obligations with respect to the Working Group up to the date of that withdrawal notice will remain in effect, but no new obligations will be incurred.

2.4. Binding Encumbrance. This License is binding on any future owner, assignee, or party who has been given the right to enforce any Necessary Claims against third parties.

3. Patent Exclusion.

3.1. As a Result of Contributions. Contributor may exclude Necessary Claims from its licensing commitments incurred under Section 2.1.1 by issuing an Exclusion Notice within 45 days of the date of that Contribution.  Contributor may not issue an Exclusion Notice for any material that has been included in a Draft Deliverable for more than 45 days prior to the date of that Contribution.

3.2. As a Result of a Draft Specification Becoming an Approved Specification. Prior to the adoption of a Draft Specification as an Approved Specification, Contributor may exclude Necessary Claims from its licensing commitments under this Agreement by issuing an Exclusion Notice.  Contributor may not issue an Exclusion Notice for patents that were eligible to have been excluded pursuant to Section 3.1.

4. Source Code License. Any source code developed by the Working Group is solely subject the source code license included in the Working Group's repository for that code.  If no source code license is included, the source code will be subject to the MIT License.

5. No Other Rights. Except as specifically set forth in this License, no other express or implied patent, trademark, copyright, or other rights are granted under this License, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.

6. Antitrust Compliance. Contributor acknowledge that it may compete with other participants in various lines of business and that it is therefore imperative that they and their respective representatives act in a manner that does not violate any applicable antitrust laws and regulations.  This License does not restrict any Contributor from engaging in similar specification development projects. Each Contributor may design, develop, manufacture, acquire or market competitive deliverables, products, and services, and conduct its business, in whatever way it chooses.  No Contributor is obligated to announce or market any products or services.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Contributors agree not to have any discussion relating to any product pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, division of markets, allocation of customers or any other topic that should not be discussed among competitors under the auspices of the Working Group.

7. Non-Circumvention. Contributor agrees that it will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of circumventing any obligations under this License.

8. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers.

8.1. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers. Contributor and Licensee represents and warrants that 1) it is legally entitled to grant the rights set forth in this License and 2) it will not intentionally include any third party materials in any Contribution unless those materials are available under terms that do not conflict with this License.  IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS ITS CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Contribution or the Specification is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein, CONTRIBUTOR AND LICENSEE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITIONS OF QUALITY, OR TITLE, RELATED TO THE CONTRIBUTION OR THE SPECIFICATION.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. Any obligations regarding the transfer, successors in interest, or assignment of Necessary Claims will be satisfied if Contributor or Licensee notifies the transferee or assignee of any patent that it knows contains Necessary Claims or necessary claims under this License. Nothing in this License requires Contributor to undertake a patent search. If Contributor is 1) employed by or acting on behalf of an employer, 2) is making a Contribution under the direction or control of a third party, or 3) is making the Contribution as a consultant, contractor, or under another similar relationship with a third party, Contributor represents that they have been authorized by that party to enter into this License on its behalf.

8.2. Distribution Disclaimer. Any distributions of technical information to third parties must include a notice materially similar to the following: "THESE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." The Contributors and Licensees expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the materials.  The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the materials is assumed by the implementer and user. IN NO EVENT WILL THE CONTRIBUTORS OR LICENSEES BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS DELIVERABLE OR ITS GOVERNING AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER MEMBER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE."

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.

d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";

c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,

d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

e. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.

e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
