# Annex F: Using SPDX to comply with Norms, Standards and Regulation (Informative)

## F.1 Satisfying NTIA Minimum Elements for an SBOM using SPDX / US Executive Order 14028 <a name="F.1"></a>

US Executive Order 14028 in conjunction with the National Telecommunications
and Information Administration (NTIA) outlined minimum elements for an SBOM.
The minimum elements are detailed in
[NTIA's Framing Software Component Transparency: Establishing a Common Software Bill of Maternials](https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/framingsbom_20191112.pdf)
and
[The Minimum Elements for a SBOM](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf)
documents and summarized below:

| SBOM Minimum Field | Description |
| ----------- | :----------- |
| Author Name | Author of the SBOM entry (this may not always be the supplier). |
| Supplier Name  | Name or identity of the supplier of the component in the SBOM entry. |
| Component Name | Designation assigned to a unit of software defined by the original supplier. |
| Version String | Version used to identify a component. |
| Component Hash | A cryptographic hash to uniquely identify a component. |
| Unique Identifier | A unique identifier to help identify components or serve as a look-up key for relevant databases. |
| Relationship | Characterizing the relationship that an upstream component X is included in software Y. |
| Timestamp | Record of the date and time of the SBOM data assembly. |

The SPDX Specification contains fields able to address each of the NTIA minimum required data fields.

| Unique Identifier | [Software/Classes/SoftwareArtifact.contentIdentifier](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/Software/Classes/SoftwareArtifact/) for SPDX Software Artifacts or [Software/Classes/Package.packageUrl](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/Software/Classes/Package/) if the packageUrl is considered to be unique,<br>or [Core/Classes/Element.externalIdentifier](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/Core/Classes/Element/) for resources outside the scope of SPDX-3.0 content </br> |
| Relationship | [Core/Classes/Relationship](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/Core/Classes/Relationship/) |

## F.2 BSI TR-03183 - Technical Guideline Cyber Resilience Requirements for Manufacturers and Products <a name="F.2"></a>

The German BSI is actively propagating its technical guideline in preparation
for adopting and detailing the requirements of the
[EU Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2024-0130_EN.html)
becoming effective in 2027.

The guideline can be regarded as German equivalent of the US Executive Order
14028. Nevertheless, BSI is exploring various options and recommendations to
further detail the content of SBOMs.

Important elements of the guideline in the context of SPDX:

- The guideline references SPDX as one of the exchange formats for SBOMs.
- It defines levels of details as well as mandatory and optional data fields.
- The guideline scopes the content (dependency relationships) of an SBOM
  (top-level, n-level, transitive, delivery item, complete).
- Different types of SBOMs (design, source, build, analysed, deployed, runtime)
  are defined.

The guideline (available in version 1.1) is currently being revised by the BSI.
Draft versions of the future 2.0 document are circulated by the BSI to collect
review comments.
