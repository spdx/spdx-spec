# 5 Conformance

## 5.1 Alternate notation for some conformance requirements <a name="5.1"></a>

This standard contains more than a few cardinality assertions, each of which
indicates absolute, optional, or conditional requirements.
Here are some examples:

- Cardinality: Mandatory, one.
- Cardinality: Optional, one or many.
- Cardinality: Mandatory, one if {condition} is true or {feature} omitted, zero
  (shall be omitted) if {condition} is false.
- Cardinality: 0..1
- Cardinality: 0..*
- Cardinality: 1..1
- Cardinality: 1..*

Each of these assertions can easily be understood as to whether a feature is
required, and if so, how many occurrences are required; also, whether a feature
is permitted, and if so, in what number. As this is the format long familiar to
the SPDX community, it has been preserved in this specification.

## 5.2 Introduction to Profiles <a name="5.2"></a>

Profile is the term for a compliance point within the SPDX community across The
Linux Foundation and OMG. The System Package Data Exchange (SPDX) specification
defines the following six compliance points, defined as “Profiles”:

- Core and Software Profiles (Clauses 6 & 7)
- Security Profile (Clause 8)
- Licencing Profile (Clause 9)
- Dataset Profile (Clause 10)
- AI Profile (Clause 11)
- Build Profile (Clause 12)
- Lite Profile (Clause 13)
- Extension Profile (Clause 14)

The Core and Software Profiles are mandatory. All others are optional.

## 5.3 Core Profile compliance point <a name="5.3"></a>

The Core Profile includes the definitions of classes properties and
vocabularies usable by all SPDX profiles when producing or consuming SPDX
content. Although the classes, properties and vocabularies are somewhat
extensive, the required fields are rather minimal to allow maximum flexibility
while meeting minimum SBOM requirements. Software that conforms to the SPDX
specification at the Core Profile compliance point shall be able to import and
export serialized documents that conform with one of the defined SPDX
serialization formats.

Conformance to the Core Profile compliance point is mandatory for all other
SPDX profiles.

This compliance point, in combination with the Software Profile compliance
point, provides a baseline of functionality that facilitates interchange of the
bills of materials information produced by tools supporting SPDX.

## 5.4 Software Profile compliance point <a name="5.4"></a>

The Software Profile includes the definitions of classes, properties and
vocabularies for refering to and conveying information about software and is
usable by all SPDX profiles when producing or consuming SPDX content.

Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Software Profile
compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that
conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization
formats.

Conformance to the Software Profile compliance point does not entail support
for the Licencing, Dataset, AI, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles of the
SPDX.

This compliance point, in combination with the Core Profile compliance point,
provides a baseline of functionality that facilitates interchange of the bills
of materials information produced by tools supporting SPDX.

## 5.5 Security Profile compliance point <a name="5.5"></a>

The Security Profile captures security-related information when producing or
consuming SPDX content.

Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the security profile
compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that
conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization
formats, including the properties and relationships specified in the security
profile, which are in support of exchanging information about software
vulnerabilities that may exist, the severity of those vulnerabilities, and a
mechanism to express how a vulnerability may affect a specific software element
including if a fix is available.

Conformance to the Security Profile compliance point does not entail support
for the Licencing, Dataset, AI, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles of the
SPDX.

This compliance point facilitates interchange of the security information
produced by tools supporting SPDX.

## 5.6 Licencing Profile compliance point <a name="5.6"></a>

The Licensing Profile includes capturing details relevant to software licensing
and intellectual property information when producing or consuming SPDX content.
Specifically, software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Licencing
profile compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized
documents that conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX
serialization formats, including the classes and fields that comprise the SPDX
License Expression syntax and that relate to the
[SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

Conformance to the Licencing Profile compliance point does not entail support
for the Software, Security, Dataset, AI, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles of
the SPDX.

This compliance point facilitates interchange of the licencing documents
expressing which licenses and copyright notices are determined by persons or
automated tooling to apply to distributions of software that are produced by
tools supporting SPDX.

## 5.7 Dataset Profile compliance point <a name="5.7"></a>

The Dataset Profile captures the relevant information about the datasets used
in an AI system or other applications when producing or consuming SPDX content.

Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Dataset Profile
compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that
conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization
formats, including details such as dataset names, versions, sources, associated
metadata, licensing information, and any other relevant attributes.
The Dataset Profile can covey a description or summary of a dataset, including
metadata, characteristics, and statistical information about the data.
The Dataset Profile can convey insights into the structure, format, content,
and properties of a dataset, helping users understand and analyze the data more
effectively.

Conformance to the Dataset Profile compliance point does not entail support
for the Software, Licencing, Security, AI, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles
of the SPDX.

This compliance point facilitates interchange of the information about
datasets produced by tools supporting SPDX.

## 5.8 AI Profile compliance point <a name="5.8"></a>

The AI Profile captures an inventory list of software components and
dependencies associated with an AI system when producing or consuming SPDX
content.

Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the AI Profile compliance
point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that conform with
one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization formats,
including the information about software components and dependencies associated
with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models and systems.
This inventory includes the software frameworks, libraries, and other
components used to build or deploy the AI system, along with relevant
information about their versions, licenses, and useful security references
including ethical and security information.

Conformance to the AI Profile compliance point does not entail support for the
Software, Licencing, Security, Dataset, Build, Lite, or Extension profiles of
the SPDX.

This compliance point facilitates interchange of the AI model related
information produced by tools supporting SPDX.

## 5.9 Build Profile compliance point <a name="5.9"></a>

The Build Profile captures build-related information when producing or
consuming SPDX content.

Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Security Profile
compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that
conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization
formats, including associated definitions to help express how software is
generated and transformed. This includes encoding the inputs, outputs,
procedures/instructions, environments and actors from the build process along
with the associated evidence.

Conformance to the Build Profile compliance point does not entail support for
the Software, Licencing, Security, Dataset, AI, Lite, or Extension profiles of
the SPDX.

This compliance point facilitates interchange of the build information produced
by tools supporting SPDX.

## 5.10 Lite Profile compliance point <a name="5.10"></a>

The Lite Profile captures the minimum set of information required for license
compliance in the software supply chain for producing or consuming SPDX
content.

Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Security Profile
compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that
conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization
formats, including creation of the SBOM, package lists with licensing and other
related items, and their relationships.

Conformance to the Lite Profile compliance point does not entail support for
the Software, Licencing, Security, Dataset, AI, Build, or Extension profiles
of the SPDX.

This compliance point facilitates interchange of minimal licencing information
when produced by tools supporting SPDX.

## 5.11 Extension Profile compliance point <a name="5.11"></a>

The Extension Profile captures extended tailored information when producing or
consuming non-standard SPDX content in three ways:

- Support Profile-based extended characterization of Elements. Enables
  specification and expression of Element characterization extensions within
  any profile and namespace of SPDX without requiring changes to other profiles
  or namespaces and without requiring local subclassing of remote classes
  (which could inhibit ecosystem interoperability in some cases).

- Support extension of SPDX by adopting individuals or communities with Element
  characterization details uniquely specialized to their particular context.
  Enables adopting individuals or communities to utilize SPDX expressive
  capabilities along with expressing more arcane Element characterization
  details specific to them and not appropriate for standardization across SPDX.

- Support structured capture of expressive solutions for gaps in SPDX coverage
  from real-world use. Enables adopting individuals or communities to express
  Element characterization details they require that are not currently defined
  in SPDX but likely should be. Enables a practical pipeline that identifies
  gaps in SPDX that should be filled, expresses solutions to those gaps in a
  way that allows the identifying adopters to use the extended solutions with
  SPDX and does not conflict with current SPDX, can be clearly detected among
  the SPDX content exchange ecosystem, provides a clear and structured
  definition of gap solution that can be used as submission for revision to the
  SPDX standard.

Software that conforms to the SPDX specification at the Extension Profile
compliance point shall be able to import and export serialized documents that
conform with one of the SPDX serialization formats defined SPDX serialization
formats, including the abstract Extension class serving as the base for all
defined Extension subclasses.

Conformance to the Extension Profile compliance point does not entail support
for the Licencing, Security, Dataset, AI, Build, or profiles of the SPDX but
is expected to be used in combination with the other profiles to extend them.

This compliance point facilitates interchange of extended information that goes
beyond the standard SPDX produced by tools supporting SPDX and is used between
cooperating parties that understand the form of the extension and can produce
and consume its non-standard content.

## 5.12 Standard data format requirements <a name="5.12"></a>

The data format specification and recommendations are subject to the
following constraints:

- Shall be in a human readable form.
- Shall be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write.
- Shall be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness automatically,
  independent of how it was generated (human or tool).
- The SPDX document character set shall support UTF-8 encoding.
- Multiple serialization formats may be used to represent the information being
  exchanged. Current supported formats include:

  - **YAML 1.2**
    see:
    [YAML Ain’t Markup Language (YAML™) version 1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/)
  - **JavaScript Object Notation** (JSON)
    see:
    [ECMA-404](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/)
    - The JSON Schema for SPDX can be found in the
      [SPDX specification Git repository schemas directory](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/master/schemas/spdx-schema.json)
  - **Resource Description Framework** (RDF, also referred to as RDF/XML)
    see:
    [RDF 1.1 XML Syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/)
  - **tag:value** flat text file as described in this specification
  - **.xls** spreadsheets

- In addition to the supported formats, the following format is in development
  with a plan to complete the specification in the next release:

  - **Extensible Markup Language** (XML)
    see:
    [Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/)

- Interoperability between all the supported file formats shall be preserved.
  SPDX defines how to validate a document in each supported format, and how to
  translate a valid document without loss to each other supported format.

- Tags and format properties are case sensitive.

- Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file.
  A suggested naming convention is:

  | Format      | Extension    |
  | ----------- | ------------ |
  | tag:value   | \*.spdx      |
  | RDF         | \*.spdx.rdf  |
  | JSON        | \*.spdx.json |
  | XML         | \*.spdx.xml  |
  | YAML        | \*.spdx.yaml or \*.spdx.yml |

- The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use
  `rdf:about="..."` to represent that a proper Uniform Resource Indicator (URI)
  should be present.
