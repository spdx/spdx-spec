# 4 Model and serializations

## 4.1 Overview <a name="4.1"></a>

This specification defines the data model of the SPDX standard, describing
every piece of information about systems with software components. The data
model is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) extensible
knowledge representation data model, which provides a flexible and extensible
way to represent and exchange information.

The data may be serialized in a variety of formats for storage and
transmission.

## 4.2 RDF serialization <a name="4.2"></a>

Since the data model is based on RDF, any SPDX data can be serialized in any of
the multiple RDF serialization formats, including but not limited to:

- JSON-LD format as defined in
  [JSON-LD 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/);
- Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) format as defined in
  [RDF 1.1 Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/);
- N-Triples format as defined in
  [RDF 1.1 N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/); and
- RDF/XML format as defined in
  [RDF 1.1 XML Syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/).

The SPDX specification is accompanied by a
[JSON-LD context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context) definition file
that can be used to serialize SPDX in a much simpler and more human-readable
JSON-LD format.

## 4.3 Canonical serialization <a name="4.3"></a>

Canonical serialization is a single, consistent, normalized, deterministic, and
reproducible form.

Such a canonical form normalizes things like ordering and formatting.

The content of the canonical serialization is exactly the same as the JSON-LD
serialization of RDF data (see 4.2), just represented in a consistent way.

Canonical serialization is in JSON format, as defined in
[RFC 8259 (IETF STD 90)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8259),
with the following additional characteristics:

- No line breaks
- Key names MUST be wrapped in double quotes
- No whitespace outside of strings
- `true`, `false` and `null`: the literal names must be lowercase; no other
  literal names are allowed
- Integers: represented in base 10 using decimal digits. This designates an
  integer component that may be prefixed with an optional minus sign.
  Leading zeros are not allowed.
- Strings: UTF-8 representation without specific canonicalisation. A string
  begins and ends with quotation marks (%x22). Any Unicode characters may be
  placed within the quotation marks, except for the two characters that MUST be
  escaped by a reverse solidus: quotation mark, reverse solidus, and the
  control characters (U+0000 through U+001F).
- Arrays: An array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero
  or more items. Items are separated by commas.
- Objects: An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets
  surrounding zero or more name/value pairs (or members). A name is a string
  containing only ASCII characters (0x21-0x7F). The names within an object must
  be unique. A single colon comes after each name, separating the name from the
  value. A single comma separates a value from a following name. The name/value
  pairs are ordered by name.

## 4.4 Serialization information <a name="4.4"></a>

A collection of elements may be serialized in multiple formats.

An SpdxDocument element represents a collection of
elements across all serialization data formats within the model.

The actual serialized bytes is represented by an Artifact element within the
model.

A Relationship of type serializedInArtifact links an SpdxDocument to one or
more serialized forms of itself.

When serializing a physical SpdxDocument, any property of the logical element
that can be natively represented within the chosen serialization format
(e.g., `@context` prefixes in JSON-LD instead of the namespaceMap) may utilize
these native mechanisms. All remaining properties shall be serialized within
the SpdxDocument element itself.

A serialization must not contain more than one SpdxDocument.

A given instance of serialization must not define more than one SpdxDocument
element.
